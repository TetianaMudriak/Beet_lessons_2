        "text": "It's no longer safe for Harry at Hogwarts, so he and his best friends, Ron and Hermione, are on the run. Professor Dumbledore has given them clues about what they need to do to defeat the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, once and for all, but it's up to them to figure out what these hints and suggestions really mean. Their cross-country odyssey has them searching desperately for the answers, while evading capture or death at every turn. At the same time, their friendship, fortitude, and sense of right and wrong are tested in ways they never could have imagined. The ultimate battle between good and evil that closes out this final chapter of the epic series takes place where Harry's Wizarding life began: at Hogwarts. The satisfying conclusion offers shocking last-minute twists, incredible acts of courage, powerful new forms of magic, and the resolution of many mysteries. Above all, this intense, cathartic book serves as a clear statement of the message at the heart of the Harry Potter series: that choice matters much more than destiny, and that love will always triumph over death.",

            "Ok, before I start a few warnings. This will contain spoilers (though since I'm writing this a year after the release I don't think it's too much of a tragedy), it will be long and it will be negative because I really didn't like this book.Reading books one to five I was very impressed with the storytelling from a novice novellist. There was magic, there were characters you could love, and sure there were some cliche'd storylines, but they were interspersed with really interesting sidestories (Peeves, SPEW, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes). I was enthralled as a teenager and I am enthralled now as an adult when I re-read them.But I have to say the the quality dropped markedly in books six and seven. The ramblings (that started out cute in GoF and OotP) have become pronounced and boring. The characters have lost much of what made them endearing, and the plot has gone to hell.Focusing on Deathly Hallows, I had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline, JKR went on to the internet, discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly, who didn't know that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, RAB was Sirius's brother, the diadem was at Hogwarts, the locket was at Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, Snape was in love with Lily and Ron would be a it and abandon Harry and Hermione?), and felt the need to come up with a new plot device. This would explain the incredible stupidity that is the deathly hallows and the plot holes and gaps in logic that involve them.Now, it has been a while since I read it so some of my names and such might be wrong, and if it does answer the questions in the book in such a round about way I apologise, but the Elder Wand does not make sense. I'm willing to accept that it follows it's own set of rules separate from those of other wands (where Haary can use Hermione's wand almost as well as his own and all of the disarming they did in book five didn't make their wands all change ownerships) but the course of events whereby Harry became the owner of the wand are just plain silly. If Grindelwald simply stole the wand from Gregorovich (sp?), how did that make him the wands owner? If the wand is unbeatable, how did Dumbledore defeat Grindelwald (I know Rita Skeeter theorised that Grindelwald surrended, but how does that pass the wand's ownership to Dumbledore. Surrender is not the same as defeat). And if the wand is unbeatable, why was Dumbledore unable to defeat Voldemort when they dueled on OotP? And also, is Harry really so conceited and stupid to think that no one would ever defeat or disarm him, making them the owner of the wand? Shouldn't he have broken it? If he does become an auror in later life someone is bound to disarm him eventually, and if they knew about the wand, they could easily steal it back from Dumbledore's tomb.The other major thing that ticked me off was the characterisation. Hermione, Harry and Ron have always been some of my favourite characters, but here they are acting completely different from previous books. Harry using Unforgivable curses without a hint of remorse, and not comforting Hermione when Ron takes off, instead staring at a 'Ginny-dot'. Can we say creepy and stalkerish? And Hermione, who for the most part was still loyal and brave and smart (loved the bottomless bag bit, and her being there for Harry at Godric's Hollow), was so pathetic when it came to Ron. I know love makes people do the wacky, but crying for days on end when they're supposed to be searching for Horcruxes, kissing him in the middle of the war because he finally showed a tiny inkling of care towards the house-elves. And Ron. Gah! I mean, I love Ron, but you would have thought he could have grown up a little, just a smidgen. But no, running away because of the locket (one ring to rule them all...). Those who defend him saying it affected him more than Harry or Hermione because he had more insecurities is just dumb. Harry and Hermione had just as much to be insecure about. Harry, with his saving-people-thing, could easily have gone nuts with the locket around his neck and ran away from the others because he was terrified that they'd get killed. And Hermione has always been insecure, about being Muggle-born, about proving herself, about Ron and Harry and their friendships. Sure, he wanted to come back the moment he left, but he still left. Which I could accept were it not for such a stupid reason. And then he got his 'super-moment' which was so lame. Honestly, 'Ron can remember and copy paseltongue', uhuh. Wouldn't it have made much more sense to say, have Ginny come along, who could possibly still say the word from when she opened it under Tom's control in CoS. And then Ron mentioned the house-elves, to make himself 'worthy' (JKR's words, not mine) of Hermione. For one thing, why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity, and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that Harry already had in abounds?Yes, I am a H/Hr shipper, but that is by no means the reason I hated this book (as you can see from above). If H/Hr had been handled as badly as R/Hr or H/G, I would have hated it. But the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between Harry and Hermione. At Grimmauld Place when Harry showed Hermione the picture, at the wedding where Hermione beamed at Harry, at Godric's Hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. While in canon, Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione, that will never convince me that they are the better couples. Harry and Hermione had the friendship, the trust, the alchemy. They were the most developed relationship in the series, and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that.The final things I feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. No depth, no meaning, just stupid-named kids. I get that JKR wanted Harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had, it could have been handled so much better. And seriously, Albus Severus? That poor kid must have been teased horribly. And why Severus? Sure, he turned out to be not evil, but for Harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on Lily. It's just gross. And unrealistic. I was so hoping there was more to Snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. Gah. It may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil, but Lily was very, very dead for a very long time, and no one holds on that hard to love. If caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive, why was it enough when she was dead?Also, the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible, and yet Moody saw through it in OotP and Dementor's could see through it in PoA, supposedly. And, my god did the death scene's suck in this book. Yes, its a war so plenty of people, including main characters were going to die, but when I felt worse about Dobby than I did about Remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. He was the last of the Marauders, for god's sake, he deserved an on-page death at the very least. Maybe defending Harry or Tonks. Something!Well, there ends the rant. There were a few good points in the novel (like Godric's Hollow, before the stupidity of Harry not realising that Bathilda was Nagini, and the awesomeness of Neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel.Read it because it is the conclusion to a series that took seventeen years to write, but do not expect the fireworks that such a finale could have been. There's better fanfics out there.",

But then again, most seventeen-year olds haven\u2019t come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every Potterhead\u2019s questions \u2014 and then some. Not only does Deathly Hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of Devil\u2019s Snare, Harry\u2019s best mate Ron bellows \u201cHAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\u201d Now, six years later, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him \u201cAre you a wizard, or what?\u201d thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem. Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowling\u2019s books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.Harry\u2019s bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harry\u2019s last tale for her long-time fans. This line seems to read as a secret \u201cshout-out\u201d to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book revealed that \u201cneither shall live while the other survives\u201d, and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. More than any of the other Potter books, Deathly Hallows is a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by Voldemort\u2019s Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears. This is not to say that Deathly Hallows doesn\u2019t offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show Potterwatch, anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.To write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but Rowling\u2019s farewell to the Boy Who Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied.",

Be warned: once started, you won't have a moment's rest till your finish this one!\n\"Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches\"\nIt seems redundant now to repeat all the good things about Harry Potter books in general - from plot to writing style - which never reached a plateau, but kept on improving. All of that is still there. But setting up the atmosphere for events has reached a level that is far beyond anything we've seen before. And the complexity of the events has also been increased. Even the few sup-plots are highly detailed and complex, and contributes a lot to the main story. It gives a very fulfilling feeling, when the reader is allowed to connect all the dots as progressing towards the end, tying up a lot of loose ends. Also, it's unbelievable how well the plot twists are introduced - whether they are happy or sad - maintaining suspense better than ever.\n\"permettez-moi to assister vous,\"\nThe reader is bound to encounter a lot of heartbreaking disappointments here, but all that help make the ending much more satisfying. I did miss the occasional humor, though it would not have complimented well the dark world we are in right now. Oh, and I'm really happy that I only had to hate Snape for a few days... (from finish of Half-blood prince till now) I guess that's the good thing about reading all the books of series at once: less anxiety!\n\"Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure!\"\nWhen I started Philosopher's Stone, it made me realize that I've been missing out on a lot - a world of magic which is full of amazing characters. Then the journey got ever so thrilling and entertaining, with each book outperforming the previous one in every possible way. It's been three magical weeks for me - literally and figuratively - from the starting of the first book till the last. I don't recall ever been immersed in a book series as much as I did with Harry Potter, and, though the ending was great, it's sad not being able to continue, to know that this is the end. I've watched the first few HP movies a long time ago, but those didn't come anywhere near the books in my opinion, and I really wasn't a fan. But now, I'm finally enlightened as to why Harry Potter series is much loved by millions. It's impossible not to, once you're through with the books! A well thought out foundation put in place in first three books, then setting stage for the core of the series in next two and finally, an incredibly thrilling ending with the last two books, while each book being a five-star read, at least for me. Harry Potter became the my all-time-favorite book series. \n\"Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,\"\n",

Let's talk about it for six pages. I loved Half-Blood Prince so much that I postponed finishing the series for five months. More context: I started rereading this series in December, I was done the sixth book in February, and I didn\u2019t pick up the finale until July.I thought this book was going to destroy me!!!And, like, it almost did. But not in the oh-my-god-this-amazing-series-is-over-cry-cry-cry way I expected. More like I, too, divided my soul into horcruxes, and they, like Voldemort\u2019s, were being taken out at an excruciatingly slow pace over the course of 784 pages. Just weakening infinitesimally and kind of being like, can you just get this over with already? But instead of, you know, my actual self being killed, it was my enthusiasm for this series and any appreciation I may have had for JK Rowling.Seriously, I feel like any love I had for a couple of the books in this series has been brutally, torturously, painstakingly extinguished.This book was a CHORE.Let\u2019s talk about why (for an extraordinarily long time).(Like all of my Harry Potter reviews, this is nothin\u2019 but spoilers.)PLOTYou saw those glorious GIFs. You know the concept for the first half of this book is Not Great.The storyline is already, like, What if we just sat around in the most depressing on Earth for a few hundred pages, jumping locations every day, having the same conversation repeatedly, and granting our readers in-depth analyses of the gross fish we\u2019re eating? (Sorry, British people, but I think we can all agree that a freezing/damp moor is no tropical vacation.) (Also shoutout to the time when Harry, Ron and Hermione overheard other wizards saying \u201cAccio salmon\u201d in order to eat and were just like, That information\u2019s going straight in the mental trash can.)But then on TOP of it, the pacing is so!! horrible!! Nothing happens, and then something will happen and take literally no effort by the golden gang. Like when a thing they need just SHOWS UP in a frozen pond. How exciting. So glad I waded through hundreds of pages of freezing moor bickering to get to this point.Also, the bickering is legitimately the same three conversations over and over and over and over.HAHAHAHA. I just remembered that the seventh book was divided into two movies. LITERALLY WHAT WENT DOWN IN THE FIRST MOVIE?? Hahahahaha. Oh man. I am just never going to watch those adaptations, probably.I\u2019m almost grateful that this book was so bad. Because now I never have to be sad it\u2019s over! I do so much better with anger.CHARACTERSLike every young woman with a semi-functional brain, I\u2019m big into Hermione. Or I was, for the first five or six books, before she was completely ruined and it was like she was never goddamn helpful or smart in the first place.IN OTHER WORDS, WHY DID J.K. ROWLING DO HERMIONE LIKE THIS?In this book, Hermione totally ignores logic in order to: a) stare lustily after Ron (Ron! Can you believe it?? We\u2019ll get to that), b) sustain the stupid arguments that keep cropping up between the supposedly-golden trio, c) also maintain the TOTALLY USELESS ROMP THROUGH THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE, and d) ignore the good ideas that are exclusively coming from Harry presumably just in order to extend the book.Which, speaking of, this book is just the goddamn Harry Potter show. He comes up with every single plan, everyone at Hogwarts defers to him like he\u2019s Team Good's Voldemort, and the whole book he\u2019s treated like this misunderstood genius, too smart for the world around him.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAGNIFICENT SIXTH-BOOK CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FOR GOD\u2019S SAKE.Ron also sucks. He is constantly complaining and picking fights. He offers exactly zero (0) good ideas throughout the book. Legitimately all he does is try to be funny AND NOT BE. I cannot believe the (usually) fab Hermione was handed off to him like some sort of prize for the biggest pumpkin at the state fair.The only character who got what they were owed in this book was Neville. Which, if I had to pick one character to get the best ending, that\u2019s who it would be, BUT STILL. His perfection is no excuse. He\u2019s barely even in the f*cking books. Impossible to mess up.And I missed Dumbledore soooo muuuuuch but then he showed up (in death or quasi-death - this book is stupid and we\u2019ll get to it) AND TALKED TO HARRY FOR EIGHT HOURS AND IT DIDN\u2019T FEEL LIKE HIM ONCE. It was just sh*tty writing and plot exposition and explanation. How DARE you use Dumbledore as a plot point.Wow, I am especially bitter today.ROMANCEEVERY SINGLE ENDGAME ROMANCE IN THIS WHOLE SERIES IS THROWN TOGETHER AND BAD. I will go through each and explain this.Harry and Ginny: Ginny is so cool in the sixth book. So cool that I took back all of the Ginny-sh*t talking I did for approximately four years. I was even open to the concept of Harry/Ginny (even their ship name must be awful, no? Hinny? OH MY GOD I AM PRAYING IT\u2019S \u201cGarry\u201d) just based off of Ginny\u2019s apparent greatness. BUT NO IT\u2019S JUST BAD. Harry spends a significant chunk of this already-boring book moping about Ginny. And it couldn\u2019t be less cute. It\u2019s just I miss Ginnyyyyyyyyy overandoverandoverandover without any mention of like, who she is. Or what their relationship is like. OR ANYTHING. It\u2019s just J.K. Rowling being like, Oh, Harry would probably miss Ginny. Here\u2019s a substance-less reminder.Ron and Hermione: like...areyoukiddingme. Not even Joanne and her terrible Twitter account are pro-Ronmione. They could NOT be less compatible. They are not fun together at all. My last words will be WHY NOT HERMIONE AND FRED. (I will scream them, which will be very startling to the loved ones who may be gathered around my hospital bed.) And no, Joanne, Harry and Hermione are not the correct answer. SERIOUSLY HOW IS HER TWITTER ACCOUNT THIS BAD. HOW DOES SHE HAVE SO MANY REGRETS ABOUT THE DUMB CHILDREN\u2019S SERIES SHE WROTE 15 YEARS AGO.Lupin and Tonks: I don\u2019t...I don\u2019t even...when do they interact? When did this happen? How am I supposed to even support this? Isn\u2019t Lupin a million years old? A shabby sloppy old were-man? Isn\u2019t Tonks a young hottie? Also, literally how f*cked up is it that everyone thinks Tonks is like mourning and blaming herself when actually she\u2019s all, \u201cWhy won\u2019t Lupin loooooooove me.\u201d Dumb.Lily and James: This one makes literally NO sense. Just because your BFF calls you a racial slur doesn\u2019t mean you have to f*ck and then marry his bully. James sucks. Just because Snape somehow sucks even harder doesn\u2019t mean that James\u2019s dreamy green eyes override his TENDENCY TO BE THE WORST PERSON IN THE MAPPED UNIVERSE. (Second-worst.)Are there any more? Actually, scratch that. If there are more I do not want to recall.WHERE IS THE GODDAMN LOGIC. SOMEONE FIND IT AND HAND IT BACK TO JOANNEOne, don\u2019t just KILL CHARACTERS TO TRY TO MAKE YOUR BOOK SEEM SAD AND POWERFUL. A good writing strategy is definitively not, \u201cOh, guess what, the stakes are high. How do you know? Um, I\u2019ll just...kill these 14 people. Who matter a lot to you nerds I guess. How crazy, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019ve emotionally manipulated you into building a devotion to these works of fiction for the entirety of your child and made a literal billion dollars off it! But this book has already been super boring? No time to mourn!!! Sorry! Whatever, bye!\u201dYou can literally watch my progression into convincing myself that J.K. Rowling is a full-on real-life witch over the course of this review. And not a Hermione type of witch. A Wizard of Oz Wicked-of-the-West witch. A Salem witch trials witch. But CAN YOU BLAME ME. She\u2019s a billionaire with nothing better to do than tweet about the project she keeps pretending she can move past!!! But she can\u2019t!!! Because she keeps writing stuff! Is a billion dollars not enough? Can you release your stupid 90-page ebooks for not-money??? I am FURIOUS. And also sleep-deprived.But back to the stupid stuff. Well, the other stupid stuff.The sh*t that goes down in this book makes literally no sense at all. Dumbledore even says, \u201cYou and Voldemort have traveled into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested,\u201d which is really Joanne saying, \u201cI have really f*cked up this time. Wow, I have no clue how this makes even a magical sense of logic of my own creation. Um, what if...can I just not explain it?\u201dHere\u2019s one example of how dumb this is. Voldemort survives death continuously because there\u2019s a piece of him in Harry, which supposedly \u201cdies\u201d when Harry dies. This is somehow the only part of Harry that isn\u2019t, like, resurrected, but whatever. There is then in turn a piece of Harry (or Lily\u2019s protection force-field thingy) within Voldemort, which is what keeps Harry alive. SO WHEN VOLDEMORT DIES, HOW DOES HARRY SURVIVE???? THIS MAKES NO SENSE NO SENSE AT ALL AND YES I REALIZE I\u2019M THE TECHNICAL-ADULT TRYING TO READ LOGIC INTO WIZARD-DEATH BUT IF JOANNE, WHO IS A MILLION YEARS OLD, IS ALLOWED TO STAY IN THIS WORLD FOREVER THEN I\u2019M ALLOWED TO DO THIS.Fair is fair.SNAPEI am barely controlling the section of my Harry Potter-related fury that is dedicated toward the pond monster/anthropomorphized dumpster/human Port-a-Potty/damp sock that is called Severus Snape. (It actually makes up 84.6% of my Potter-anger, so you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.)All I will say is that there is a Snape rant coming, but I am almost frightened to write it. I think when I start typing I may transform into some sort of anger-monster. In four stages. Duh. Like the cover of an Animorphs book.I\u2019m going to go drown my sorrows in A Very Potter Musical now.Bottom line: The number one item on my bucket list is \u201cget in an Internet fight with J.K. Rowling.\u201d AVERAGE SERIES RATING: 3.57 starsQUESTION: Should I read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child???-------------------------whoops, my hand must have slipped. either that or this book was garb\u00e0ge.regardless, i'll never admit to being wrong. ever. in my life. i am always correct and perfect and infallible. that's actually in the fine print of the contract you agree to when sending me a friend request.

I felt how it's different than the movie,The characters more alive ,forcing you to feel that they're your friends, like you're already living with them in the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,it was like my other HomeI finished the series in Arabic and start it in English 2 years ago,It was still fresh and as thrilling, emotional ,great as ever.Here I'll try to stick to review that part of the series only ,till I write more about the experince of living The Harry Potter SagaThe Plot********Remember before book 7 release how were we been feeling?**Harry still got 4 Horcruxes to find -and even to know what it'll be- and even how to destroy it.**And then Fight the 7th Part of the shuttered soul...Voldemort himself, his Death Eaters and the traitor Snape. **How he can do all that without Dumbledore , Black and all of those he can't tell about his quest as Dumbledore ask him to not tell but to Ron and Hermione.We all thought it will be difficult to fit it all in one last volume ,and to wrap up characters and events. But the amazing plot of that book didn't only fit for that all. and also add a new element \"The Deathly Hallows\" and fit it perfectly into the full story.. I can't believe how that book fit everything we're all been asking about since the very early beginning ,and some of the facts that anyone wondered about like How the trace dedicate the underage magic, Why we can't just create food from thin air, or why there was a Taboo on saying \"Voldemort\"'s name..and so more.It dive deeply into the past of important characters we thought we know enough , Dumbledore and Snape.From the beginning you see a wrapping up for the characters,the places -like Private Drive- and the events.. you'll see a lines that connected to the very early of the series and book one..you'll be in a journey toward the ending without feeling disconnected from the whole previous events and characters.There's no something you'll feel-if u pay enough attention - out of place ,out of the plot or out of the characters .The Characters **************Was so glad that J.K.Rowling announce that there's no \"new\" character presented in the last books which was perfect since it's the end of the series and it's better to focus on our beloved characters and the ones we lived wit them for years.The characters deals here with the \"real responsibilities\" that comes with the coming of age. or the quest they asked for and they have to do for their good and greater goodThere were no any \"Exaggeration\" or over acting, the characters go normally ,naturally and very real, The writer chose to describe even the smallest feelings they feel in some important situations like for example Harry's final visit to the Dark Forest, or the boredom of the days on the run from place to place.And won't forget the wrapping up of Every character sometimes with surprises which is never out of character.She was always have it all planned and well drawn   The Message ***********I have to admit at my second reading I find an extraordinary spiritual amazing messageIt starts with the 2 quotations one is pagan, and one is from a Christian tradition.. one about the Death and one about Friends..and it fit perfectly to the theme of the book,and the message of Love that can beat any other force.I saw also a symbol in the Dumbledore's character and the whole Harry -Dumbledore's relation, complicated symbol of Faith, religion and religious people. in many ways that you have to look carefully to dedicate it.\u0650\u0650And look at the final fight between Harry and Voldemort ..I was like..My God you're the best writer EVER\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. But before you try to kill me, I\u2019d advise you to think about what you\u2019ve done. . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\u201d \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. \u201cIt\u2019s your one last chance,\u201d said Harry, \u201cit\u2019s all you\u2019ve got left. . . . I\u2019ve seen what you\u2019ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . .\u201d  It's not just normal fight between Good and Evil , It's amazing written novel.Can't seriously describe all of what I want to say about this series Just one thing I can admit,It's my wonderful journey, It's my friends, It's the books that made me- trying to be- a better person. It's where I meet my friends.. It's where I truly Laugh while reading/living the story..It's where I cry with characters and feel sorry for some. It's magic..It's real magic cause It's words of Love So glad to finish it at 2nd May, And so strange I didn't feel I'm going to miss the Harry Potter books although I finished it before in Arabic, and that was the ending of my experience with it in English, But deep inside me is sure I'll go back to Hogwarts again ,re-reading from one to seven soon ISA.Before I finish I have to share this great man's word..Who really was the best transforming a paper character to a real life Thank you Joanna Rowling.

I liked that.but the newspaper articles about the backstory was boring. & the part before the main story begins, & the camping-no-clues part, without anything interesting (or useful) happens were slow.This is the most emotional book in HP series; from the beginning. maybe the most crying book of my whole life:I cried at first, 25%, in the middle, later in the middle, in 75% & many times toward the end:(view spoiler)[Hedwig's death, Kreacher's tale & Regulus' bravery & kindness & acts trying to make his mistake right (why if my fav character is not the main hero, they ended up already dead?!\ud83d\ude2d James & Regulus), the scene of James & Lily's death was very emotional, especially at the end when little Harry found out something was wrong, Luna's room, even cried (a bit tho) for wormtail, Dobby's death, many Deaths in the battle of Hogwarts\ud83d\ude2d the Forest again; how he felt about Life when it was going to an end, his courage to face the his destiny... & Always (I liked Snape just because he made hard times for Harry. (ahhhh Evil me!) although I can't forgive Snape as Harry did; but this part was very emotional & he turned out to be a hero.) (hide spoiler)] sobbing & curling in the corner. (I am even crying now as I'm just typing these.)always crying; at all the readings.also Stephen Fry narrating was amazing; made me cry even more & also at the last 40%.All his emotions not just in quotes, but in Harry's thoughts, memories & feelings, all their tones, all parts their voices broke, shattered or trembled, now very very tangible & more realistic. (better than my imagination; also Harry's voice is exactly the voice I always heard in my head reading the books.)I love this book!I think in my 7th read, I cried even more over my most crying book.(I mean, I cried all over the 'forest again' chapter & the last sentences made me completely burst into tears.)don't worry, it has fun times too.the ending was brilliant! mysteries solved! (& I'm mad about changing it in the movie!)epic battle! (view spoiler)[I had kinda subconsciously known before I read it for the first time that where the end battle would be. it just made sense that way. back Home one last time, defend Hogwarts.\u201cHogwarts was the first and best home he had known.\u201d(I mean can you imagine the battle between Harry & Voldemort after he destroyed all the horcruxes happening in like an unknown nowhere land or something?-nope, right? XD) (hide spoiler)]Romione & then Harry's reaction was priceless!and the Flaw in the Plan....One of my favourite chapters in the whole HP! I love the last battle. I love the way Harry explained it. (confident! courageous! sassy! taunting!) the clues even I, as a reader, might have missed. (at least in the first read I did. that's the whole point of a story being a legend, you don't see the clues wrapping up in the story until it's explained & next times you re-read it, you'll see them.)I can read those last 3 chapters over & over again.so exciting! so epic! so brilliant! (& they CHANGED that in the movies! How DARE they!?)I was at the edge of my seat for the last 30%. all of it. in most of my readings. so thrilling! never gets old!Harry is smart & brave.& I love the epilogue. fun & great.2021 May: now I can say I read the whole HP series 10 times, yay! until next time!& at my first read, I was afraid about how the story would be ended (because Harry is my favourite character) & this was my first series (no experience, no reader prediction ability, etc, etc.(view spoiler)[& I thought he must die (& at that time, I didn't have a clue he was \"you-know-what\". I just thought the story only ended when Harry dies. (actually I was afraid series only ended when the hero dies in General, so that way no other books would come out.)

You still have time to back out though, so don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t been warned.^^\nTo J.K. Rowling, \nthere is no argument about your brilliance. You are a certified genius, a person with superhuman writing ability and imagination and I can\u2019t praise you enough for writing these books that have forever changed my life. But you\u2019re still human and surely you\u2019ve recognized your flaws. One of which is your penchant for killing your characters. You can\u2019t blame me for thinking that one of the reasons you created so many great and memorable characters is for you to be able to kill as many of them as you want to. I accept though with the heaviest heart that certain characters needed to die, needed to sacrifice their lives for the greater good but I find no good reason for the death of (view spoiler)[Fred! (hide spoiler)]. Why? Why kill him? Haven\u2019t you killed enough already? Why did he even have to die?! Why not Percy instead? (kidding). I honestly think no Weasley should have died for obvious reasons I don\u2019t think I still have to enumerate. Also, I honestly believe the last book lacks at least 200 more pages. Why jump to 19 years later epilogue right after the devastating war? Don\u2019t the rest of the other characters deserve a few pages about them? A simple tribute perhaps to all their sacrifice and pain and loss? I have gone so far, have read hundreds and hundreds of pages from book one only to be spared of better resolutions before an epilogue. Also, don\u2019t you think (view spoiler)[Professor Severus Snape (hide spoiler)] deserved a better, more respectful way to die? And whatever happened to (view spoiler)[Professor Moody\u2019s (hide spoiler)]body? So you see, even though I admire you with 99.72 percent of my heart, .28 percent percent is resenting your choices. But thank you. Now my heart is tougher and braver. Characters in the next books I read could all die and I probably wouldn\u2019t shed a tear. I just wish I read your books before Allegiant and Mockingjay. I probably would have considered those happy endings. \nTo Harry Potter\n, I will never forget your brave and pure heart. You showed me that heroes can be an average boy with no special superpowers except courage, trustworthy instincts and strength of will, oh and of course, a bunch of awesome wizards and witches supporting and protecting him the best way they can.  \nTo Hermione Granger \n, you are the most kick-ass heroine I\u2019ve ever met without needing to actually kick ass. You only needed your intellect, level headedness and kind heart and like Ron said, without you and your beaded bag, he and Harry would not have survived a day during your quest. \nTo Ron Weasley\n, you probably are the biggest idiot in the story but you showed the best of you in times you are needed the most. I admire your loyalty, sarcasm and free spirit and there is no better man for Hermione than you.  \nTo Fred and George\n, when in tears, I could always count on you guys for a good laugh. It's no fun without you. (view spoiler)[George, it\u2019s hard enough losing a part of your body but to have to lose your twin brother too. Oh Gaaaaawd! *wails*  (hide spoiler)] \nTo Hagrid (and Graupy) \n, *hugs* I\u2019ll never forget your gallons of tears and rock cakes! Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and bravery. You will be remembered for generations.  \nTo Professor Snape,\nyou are indeed the bravest of them all. Your sacrifice is utterly selfless and certainly the biggest of all. Your memories Harry and I saw in Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve ripped my heart to pieces and I spent days and nights crying for you. You're a true hero and you deserve a monument. Maybe I'll name my son after you. *wails* \nTo Professor Dumbledore\n, you are the true epitome of sacrifice, love and humility. You find something good in every person and you never fail to offer kindness even to those others deem undeserving. \nTo Dumbledore\u2019s Army led by Neville, Luna, Ginny,\n, you guys are awesome! \nTo the Order of the Phoenix,\n you were amazing especially you Mrs. Weasley! I\u2019m so sorry for your losses but thank you, thank you so much. \nTo the Hogwarts Professors led by Prof. Mc Gonagall\n, you did an amazing job holding off Voldy! You were all brilliant! \nTo the Malfoys,\nuh I don\u2019t know. How about I just stick my tongue out at the lot of you! \nTo Dobby, \n *wails* I can\u2019t\u2026just thank you so much. You\u2019re the most loyal elf. The bravest free elf I know. \nTo Kreacher,\n you poor thing. I had no idea what you had to go through and what made you the way you are. In the end, thank you for your bravery and for leading the elves to the battle. \nTo the Death Eaters and Snatchers led by Bellatrix and Greyback\n, I have two words foryou. \u201cAVADA KEDAVRA!\u201d \nTo Umbridge,\n off to Azkaban, you go!  \nTo Voldemort\n, that\u2019s right, I dare! I am completely with Harry, You don\u2019t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you? \nTo the rest of the fallen,\n (view spoiler)[Professor Moody, Cedrick, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, James and Lily, Colleen Creevey and many others (hide spoiler)], like Neville said, your death was not in vain. Thank you! *wails* \nTo the movie makers and actors\n, thank you for bringing to life the characters we love. We will always look up to you people. Don't you dare disappoint us!^^\nTo my Goodreads friends who bullied me into reading Harry Potter,\n thank you for destroying my life! I was doing perfectly fine without these books. You wrecked me pretty bad especially when I was reading the last book. I felt like hundreds of Dementors were surrounding me while reading it that I had to constantly cast a Patronus Charm while reading. It was really exhausting. My Patronus is a baby elephant, btw! Oh and I'm House Gryffindor, hurray! I'm afraid, I'm becoming worse than Luna Lovegood.\nTo Jia and Kyra\n, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, my young, smart and beautiful friends (March 06 is their actual birthday).

Even though the book is slow burn, I didn\u2019t mind as long as I already know where it goes. It might be my fourth time read and I\u2019m so sure it won\u2019t be last! So many people may think why we connect with HP books so deeply? My answer is it awakens different feelings that change at each people. For me: it brings out so many complex feelings: an emotional trip in memory lane that reminds of my excitement at each time I start a new book of the series. Hope, sadness, fear always blended. Seeing my favorite characters\u2019 growing up, making mistakes, choosing their paths and evolving are the best things I\u2019ve witnessed! The entire final book focuses on Harry\u2019s teaming up with his friends- more like family- Ron and Hermione to finish the task Dumbledore gave them. The ending of the book gives us the epic final that has been promised from the beginning. Its big screen adaptation truly reflected the terror, emotional breakdowns, excitement of the conclusion even though making two additional movies from one book was not the best idea! Prisoner of Azkaban is gonna be my favorite book of the series( the author\u2019s significant walk to the dark side and Harry\u2019s big discovery about his godfather) but it was still great to have fourth tango with the final book of the series! I think it\u2019s time for me head out Universal Studios to visit Hogswart and have a thrill ride for showing my tribute to this strongest installment of the century!

            "REVIEW TO COME TOMORROW\n'Do not Pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love.'\nit still feels weird to me me for finishing this series. I mean, I had read this series since August and I feel really ... weird. I feel like I just bought the first book yesterday instead of months ago. I feel like I just read the first book yesterday instead of months ago. Months ago, I thought I would feel okay when I finished this series but I do not feel that way. I feel ... like empty or hollow on the inside, you know what I mean, right? like there is this sad feeling and you just want to read it forever and ever but you can't because the story is over and there is nothing you can do. the only thing you can do is hugging the book because that way you would feel much better, like you actually hug the main characters.maybe this is how it feels like when you have to say goodbye to your best friends who have always be with you. no matter how difficult the situation is but they are there. I always envy those people who grew up with Harry Potter series. I envy them because they have such incredible childhood and me, I was a muggle that time and I used to hate reading novels so much and I had never once thought that I would love reading novels as much as I love breathing. Harry Potter series also has a great impact in my life. I was the kind of girl who always shy and never be myself because before reading HP I wanted people to like me, so I became what they wanted me to be and I rarely stood up for myself even when I knew I was right but Harry Potter series has changed me. you guys do know Luna, don't you? many people called her \" Loony \" because she believed in many things but Luna didn't care what they called her, she kept being herself and she had never ashamed to show her true self and that was the time I realized I was such a stupid girl who let my so-called friends changed me to be the girl I didn't even want me to be and now, my friends often say that I am such a weirdo or crazy girl who is very different from them because I love reading books so much and you know what? I just don't care about them anymore. I don't care when they say about me such a weirdo because I am not ashamed of being myself anymore because this is who I am and Luna also taught me one more thing, when you are being yourself and everyone teases you because of it. don't you ever worry about it because your true friends will come to you. these friends will accept who you are. Just like Luna who has amazing friends, Harry Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Neville.like I told you, I used to be very shy that I never stood up for even myself. few weeks ago, my friend who always insulted me, she insulted me again and no one in class was brave enough to stand up for themselves. the next thing I knew was that I snapped back at her and she was shocked and she has never insulted me again since that accident and she is kind of nice to me and we're friends now.This series has changed me to be a braver person. I don't think I can say this is a review because it's all about me and one more thing,,(view spoiler)[ I will never ever forget 2nd May 1998. I lost so many great friends Remus, Tonks, Colin, Fred, Sirius and many more.   (hide spoiler)]I really want to say many thank you to Mrs. J. K. Rowling who wrote this awesome series because this series has changed me to be a better person and this series also changed me to be so much braver person. Thank you very much, Mrs. J. K. Rowling and thank you very much for reading this guys. \u2764\u2764\u2764P.S. I found all these wonderful pictures on Google. Many thanks for the creators.",

Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play will receive its world premiere in London\u2019s West End on July 30, 2016.It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn\u2019t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.",

            "3 1/2 stars. I completely get why many HP fans will be disappointed with this, but I have to admit: I really enjoyed it. I'd love to see this story play out on stage.So yeah, I understand the sad feelings. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has a completely different vibe. Aside from being a play, it's also a more mature, character-driven, less magical story. It does not feel like an eighth Harry Potter book at all; there's a real disconnect between this play and the other seven novels. And you know what? I'm so glad. I guess it's just what you're hoping for. To be honest, I never wanted another Harry Potter book. The thought of extending a series I loved so much actually made me NOT want to read this. I got to the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and thought it was magical perfection - the story had completed its arc in full and I put it aside feeling a slight melancholy, but a whole lot of satisfaction. I didn't want more.However, if you went crazy needing more from the HP series, you'll probably be disappointed by this. If you feel there's a gap where something HP is missing, then I don't think this will fill it. Separate the two in your mind, and you have a better chance of liking it. Because this is something different - and I'm happy about it.First, of course, it's a play. Right away it's going to be something unlike what we've seen before. I don't usually love to read plays, especially modern ones, but this one is very readable because the dialogue is wonderful. I don't know why people are saying \"it's so obvious JKR didn't write most of this\" because I think her style is all over it - the very fact that this play (which is meant to be viewed on stage) can be just as easily read like a book tells me JKR had a lot of input.Also, it's funny. Much more consistently comical than the books, but with the same style of humour - i.e. lots of Ron being a buffoon. \nHermione: If some part of Voldemort survived, in whatever form, we need to be prepared. And I\u2019m scared.Ginny: I\u2019m scared too.Ron: Nothing scares me. Apart from Mum.\nThe plot leaves a little something to be desired. Again, it feels different from the main series. It's not so much about the world and magic, but more about relationships, conflicts (particularly between Harry and Albus) and the dialogue between characters. I suppose this makes more sense in a play, where the story unravels through dialogue and not through an omniscient narrator.And, as I touched upon earlier, it feels... older. I don't know how well kids will appreciate the jokes about growing old and how Ron now says \"oof\" every time he sits down. Or the family drama between Harry and his son, Albus. But I liked it. I'm happy with this addition. I truly am. If it had been too similar to the seven novels, I feel it would have risked reopening a series that had been closed in a great place. Instead, we have something very unique and, for me, very entertaining. Some of the staging directions also leave me excited about seeing the play (when I win the lottery or acquire a magic wand, maybe).One thing I have to say that I said in another comment thread: NOW, it's time to stop. This was a risky experiment and it turned out to be fun, but JKR needs to leave this world alone now. I really do not want to read about old-age Harry, Ron and Hermione rolling around in magical wheelchairs. So, just stop.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store",

Rowling can write a dictionary with Harry Potter illustrations and I'd probably give it 4 stars, so my rating is almost irrelevant here, given my extreme bias.The thing is, it was cute, it was sweet, it was entirely nostalgic to see the old crew again, but I hated the play format. As a person who grew up with Harry Potter, and who is in her early 30s now, I feel like I grew up with Harry Potter and the crew, and with the advent of this book, I have, in fact, grown old with them. It was lovely to see them again. It was like meeting old friends.I don't feel old. I'm a more responsible person, for sure, but I feel young at heart. When we're young, adulthood, responsibilities, just the prospect of adulting seem so daunting...then one gets there and it's like, well, I'm as immature as I ever was. I love fun as much as I ever did. Growing old isn't that bad. And seeing the old crew being as much as they ever were brings joy into my not-yet-old-and-grizzled-heart.I could do without the kids, to be honest. Oh, sure, they're little Potter and Granger-Weasley spawns, but come on, nobody ever has and nobody ever will win me over as much as their parents, whom I have loved the instant we met them on the Hogwarts Express.(Ok, maybe not Ron...)But I digress. The kids aren't all bad. I rather like little Scorpius, actually.\nSCORPIUS: And it\u2019s just like my father\u2019s! I got his nose, his hair, and his name. Not that that\u2019s a great thing either. I mean \u2014 father-son issues, I have them. But, on the whole, I\u2019d rather be a Malfoy than, you know, the son of the Dark Lord.\nThe adults have grown, they've changed. Some have changed so much that I hardly recognize them, Draco, for instance. I like that he's, well, nicer now, but he doesn't feel like Draco, you know? I've been so used to Harry and Draco doing this...That it's rather discombobulating to see anything otherwise.But yeah, characters are great, but the format. THE FORMAT. I don't even know it's fair of me to judge this based on the fact that I don't like that it's a play, because for fuck's sakes, IT'S A PLAY. Like, what did I expect? This may be the most confusing review I've ever written. I just don't like the play format. It's meant for the stage. That means it's up to the skill of the actors to portray what is implied. It's up to the audience to interpret nuances. It is almost entirely based on dialogue, and I hate that. I miss Rowling's writing. I love Rowling's writing, and I wanted more of it. The play brings up so many things that could have been written so much more, had it been expanded into a book format. The children's growing pains, particular that of young Albus. Harry's feelings as a parent. Draco's struggles with who he was and who he is. Furthermore, Ron is relegated to little more than comic relief. Let's be honest, I never liked the guy, but for him to be much of the same character that he ever was conjures up the image of the try-hard middle-aged dude, and I know that Ron is more than that.I like it? I don't like it? I don't know. But I would certainly relish watching it on the stage if I ever had the chance. It's bound to be better than on paper.",

Reading this really felt like Harry Potter fan-fiction to me, partly because it's hard to wrap my head around an 8th (sort of) Harry Potter story and partly because reading it as a play instead of a novel just made it feel...less like Harry Potter. I didn't dislike it; I definitely didn't love it--but I do want to be fair and say that reading a play is never, never as good as seeing the live production. In theory maybe this book shouldn't exist because it won't ever do the story justice. However, I'm glad I got to read it because I don't think I'll ever get to London to see the real deal, and at least now I know what it's all about.",

They just had no depth to them; they\u2019re like reflections of their surface level. Ron felt like a piece of furniture that seemed to enjoy inserting several badly times jokes. Hermione seemed cold. And Harry, Harry simply isn\u2019t Harry. How can he identify himself as a bad farther? How can he believe that he had no farther figure in his own life? He had many. He had inspiration from many great men. They taught him a great deal about life and himself in the process. So why would a man who has defeated the face of evil be so daunted by giving his son some simple advice? It doesn\u2019t add up. Harry Potter would make an excellent farther. This didn\u2019t even feel like the same world.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________",

            "\n\nThis review contains *mild spoilers*.I've waited for this particular story for what feels like ages, and words cannot even describe for how grateful I am that it finally exists in my hands. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child continues the wondrous magical world that we all know and love.The story starts out at King's Cross with the original trio preparing their school-age children to board the train to start their first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.It's at this time that Harry and his son, Albus, share a nice father-son moment:\u201cAlbus: Dad . . .Do you think \u2014 what if I am \u2014 what if I\u2019m put in Slytherin . . .Harry: And what would be wrong with that?Albus: Slytherin is the House of the snake, of Dark Magic . . . It\u2019s not a House of brave wizards.Harry: Albus Severus, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\u201d(I dislike Snape, but the overall conversation made me tear up a bit.)I also really appreciated that they talked about Slytherin in a positive light.We have a few time jumps here and there, and then complications arise because Harry - Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement - seized an illegal Time-Turner from Theodore Nott and has kept it.\u201cThe once-great Harry Potter, now a stone-cold Ministry man.\u201dMeanwhile, Albus gets sorted into Slytherin and struggles with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted.Harry tries to reach out to Albus but finds that he has diffuclity understanding someone different. And their connection wobbles from year to year because of it.\u201cHarry: Do you want a hand? Packing. I always loved packing. It meant I was leaving Privet Drive and going back to Hogwarts. Which was . . . well, I know you don\u2019t love it but . . .Albus: For you, it\u2019s the greatest place on earth. I know. The poor orphan, bullied by his uncle and aunt Dursley . . .Harry: Albus, please \u2014 can we just \u2014Albus: . . . traumatized by his cousin, Dudley, saved by Hogwarts. I know it all, Dad. Blah, blah, blah.Harry: I\u2019m not going to rise to your bait, Albus Potter.Albus: The poor orphan who went on to save us all. So may I say \u2014 on behalf of wizarding kind \u2014 how grateful we are for your heroism. Should we bow now or will a curtsy do?Harry: Albus, please \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve never wanted gratitude.Albus: But right now I\u2019m overflowing with it \u2014 it must be the kind gift of this moldy blanket that did it . . .Harry: Moldy blanket?Albus: What did you think would happen? We\u2019d hug. I\u2019d tell you I always loved you. What? What?Harry (finally losing his temper): You know what? I\u2019m done with being made responsible for your unhappiness. At least you\u2019ve got a dad. Because I didn\u2019t, okay?Albus: And you think that was unlucky? I don\u2019t.Harry: You wish me dead?Albus: No! I just wish you weren\u2019t my dad.\u201dHarry and Albus are trying to reach each other here, both are failing.As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes darkness comes from unexpected places.The Cursed Child answered a lot of topics that had been left unanswered in my mind, and it makes my heart tighten just thinking about everything.\u201cHarry: And I\u2019ve locked away the map. You won\u2019t see it again. Your mum left your room exactly as it was when you ran away \u2014 you know that? Wouldn\u2019t let me go in \u2014 wouldn\u2019t let anyone go in \u2014 you really scared her . . . And me.Albus: Really scared you?Harry: Yes.Albus: I thought Harry Potter wasn\u2019t afraid of anything?Harry: Is that how I make you feel?Albus looks at his dad, trying to figure him out.ALBUS: I don\u2019t think Scorpius said, but when we returned after failing to fix the first task, I was suddenly in Gryffindor House. Nothing was better between us then either \u2014 so \u2014 the fact that I\u2019m in Slytherin \u2014 that\u2019s not the reason for our problems. It\u2019s not just about that.\u201dI really appreciated that their relationship was developed in a very honest and raw way.And not only theirs, but the development of Draco and his son, Scorpius, was truly melting my everything.\u201cDraco: Astoria always knew that she was not destined for old age. She wanted me to have somebody when she left, because . . . it is exceptionally lonely, being Draco Malfoy. I never realized, though, that by hiding him away from this gossiping, judgmental world, I ensured that my son would emerge shrouded in worse suspicion than I ever endured.Harry: Love blinds. We have both tried to give our sons, not what they needed, but what we needed. We\u2019ve been so busy trying to rewrite our own pasts, we\u2019ve blighted their present.\u201dWatching Draco care deeply and fiercely for his child made me open up my heart.Oh, and I wanted to mention how ecstatic I was when Albus befriended a Malfoy. Their friendship was inspiring until the very last heartbreaking page.\u201cScorpius: Your dad thinks the rumors are true \u2014 I am the son of Voldemort?Albus (nods): His department are currently investigating it.Scorpius: Good. Let them. Sometimes \u2014 sometimes I find myself thinking \u2014 maybe they\u2019re true too.Albus: No. They\u2019re not true. And I\u2019ll tell you why. Because I don\u2019t think Voldemort is capable of having a kind son \u2014 and you\u2019re kind, Scorpius. To the depths of your belly, to the tips of your fingers. I truly believe Voldemort \u2014 Voldemort couldn\u2019t have a child like you.Scorpius: That\u2019s nice \u2014 that\u2019s a nice thing to say.Albus: And it\u2019s something I should have said a long time ago. In fact, you\u2019re probably the best person I know. And you don\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t \u2014 hold me back. You make me stronger \u2014 and when Dad forced us apart \u2014 without you \u2014Scorpius: I didn\u2019t much like my life without you in it either.\"We also had a lot of unexpected returns from the people that ended up sacrificing themselves in previous books, which truly broke me\u2014 I kept looking for Fred Weasley to show up and crack a joke... but, alas, you can't always get what you want. But to end this review on a more positive note, I want to mention my favorites: Hermione and Ron. \u201cRon: I mean, we\u2019ve been together so long \u2014 and married for so long \u2014 I mean, so long \u2014Hermione: If this is your way of saying you want a marital break, Ron, then, to be clear, I will skewer you with this quill.Ron: Shut up. Will you shut up for once? I want to do one of those marriage renewal things I\u2019ve read about. Marriage renewal. What do you think?Hermione (melting slightly): You want to marry me again?Ron: Well, we were only young when we did it the first time and I got very drunk and \u2014 well, to be honest, I can\u2019t remember much of it and . . . The truth is \u2014 I love you, Hermione Granger, and whatever time says \u2014 I\u2019d like the opportunity to say so in front of lots of other people. Again. Sober.She looks at him, she smiles, she pulls him to her, she kisses him.Hermione: You\u2019re sweet.Ron: And you taste of toffee . . .\u201dI'm always up for more canon Romione.To sum up, I thought at first that the format of the story would interfere with getting completely pulled in, but I needn't have worried\u2014 this book was the definition of unputdownable. It truly didn't take long for me to realize how much I missed reading about Harry Potter and his magical surroundings. Hogwarts will always be like home. And now... I'm getting tearful just thinking about what an impact it made on me, as both the reader and person I am today.Also, it was pretty nice getting to know that both Harry Potter and I are afraid of pigeons:\u201cHarry: You told me you don\u2019t think I\u2019m scared of anything, and that \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m scared of everything. I mean, I\u2019m afraid of the dark, did you know that?Albus: Harry Potter is afraid of the dark?Harry: I don\u2019t like small spaces and \u2014 I\u2019ve never told anyone this, but I don\u2019t much like \u2014 (he hesitates before saying it) pigeons.Albus: You don\u2019t like pigeons?Harry (he scrunches up his face): Nasty, pecky, dirty things. They give me the creeps.\u201dYes, Harry!!Oh, and my favorite acts were acts 2 & 4\u2014 because family dynamics and mystery!!Just... I'm so glad this book exists, I truly missed my favorite trio.5/5 stars (of course)*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

            "Reviewed by: Rabid ReadsRULE FOR SPOILERS: if it's in the first 10%, and therefore (in most cases) available for scrutiny from undecided readers in the FREE downloadable preview, IT'S NOT A SPOILER.That being said, a LOT of things happen--IMPORTANT things--in the first five percent, let alone ten percent of HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD, so if you'd rather go into your read without significant prior knowledge, leave this review immediately.That's the only warning you're going to get.In my experience there are two types of hardcore fans for any given series:1. The Blind Zealot.This type of fan will forgive an author almost anything. Inconsistent behavior in main characters, enormous plot holes, unexplained developments, etc., it doesn't matter, b/c OHMAGAWD, I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! *squeeeeeeee*2. The Thoughtful, Critical Reader.This type of fan loves a series based solely on its merit. They aren't blind to the aforementioned plot holes or inconsistent characters, they are in fact disappointed by such occurrences, but they can still maintain LOVE for the overall series. For example, I LOVE HARRY POTTER, but I did not love HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, b/c I felt Rowling encapsulated all the teenangsty emotions of adolescence a little bit too thoroughly. It was, in a word, exhausting.PLOT TWIST: I think both types of fans are equally likely to have issues with this latest addition to their Harry Potter library.Blind Zealots:The trouble with ending a series is that if it's done well, you have all the answers to all of your questions, and a vague enough HEA-type scenario that your well-loved cast of characters is assured whatever it is that they deserve. Heroines and Heroes live happily ever after, Villains and Minions are thwarted and punished, and while you aren't foolish enough to think everyone's adventures are over, Good continuing to triumph over Evil is reasonably guaranteed. BUT.Once you've finished something, the only way to reopen it is too create new conflict--without conflict there's no story. Suddenly the nebulous \"HEA\" isn't so nebulous, and that new clarity jeopardizes everything you've happily assumed about what comes next.Harry, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron, previously cardboard cutouts of adult wizards, become real parents with real children, and those children must grow up, making mistakes while they do it, and, worse, they must go through puberty and all the angst that entails.That's not happily ever after . . . That's REAL LIFE. Then Real Life takes your daydream of a-son-of-Harry-Potter being sorted into Slytherin and reinventing the house's image with the kind of unaffected rebelliousness you associated with a teenaged Sirius Black, and crushes it under its heel, forcing you to realize that wizards . . . are kind of assholes.So now, adding insult to injury, the image of the utopian magical society that sprang fully formed from Voldemort's ashes is forever ruined.A Blind Zealot might find ignorance preferable to that turn of events.But those aren't my issues. My issues are thus:1. I HATE TIME TRAVEL.I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I'm an escapist reader. I need to be consumed by a book to fully enjoy it, and that means I NEED to be able to believe what I'm reading is the truth.BUT.Time travel destroys the possibility of believing anything, b/c it's ALL subject to change. Why mourn a character's death if it will more than likely be nullified in the next chapter or two? Why dredge up any outrage on a character's behalf when the object of her torment will be thwarted during the second take?For me, it's not an issue of, \"why would I?\" It's an issue of, \"I can't.\" And if I can't feel anything in response to your characters or your story, why would I read your book?2. Resurrecting Voldemort-as-villain is lazy. And infuriating.We survived three of Voldemort's failed attempts at rebirth, we survived one success, and we survived a three book revelation that essentially said we had to kill him SEVEN TIMES for his death to actually stick.After all of that, how could anyone think it would be a Good Idea to bring him back AGAIN?Admittedly, it wasn't quite that simple, but . . . it was also exactly that simple. Everything and everyone else connected to ye olde grande scheme was superfluous, merely the means of achieving a so-very-tired end.As for the aforementioned superfluous detail: (view spoiler)[I recognize the futility of relying on Bellatrix LeStrange's marital status as an argument against her conceiving Voldemort's child. That crazy bitch was probably so euphoric at the idea of giving birth to her Master's spawn that she felt no pain during the actual delivery.BUT.No matter how much he wished it, Voldemort wasn't actually a god, so divine conception was an impossibility . . . Which means . . . He would have had to . . . Physically . . . Have . . . Sex . . . In order to produce offspring.O______OI don't think Bellatrix would've objected to the necessity--we've already established that she's a CRAZY BITCH.BUT . . . I'm not convinced he was physically able:A. At the alleged time of procreation, he was more snake than man. B. Snakes don't have noses, neither did Voldemort.C. Snakes don't have . . . do-NOT-make-me-say-it-you-know-where-this-is-going.That's all I'm sayin'. *shrugs awkwardly*  (hide spoiler)]3. Unnecessary drama.At first I debated whether or not it was fair to fault a staged production for being overly dramatic, but I hate unnecessary drama on the screen as much as I hate it on paper, so, YES, it most definitely is fair.A. Stop crying, dammit. Especially you, Harry. *rolls eyes*B. Ginny's instant escalation from concerned-but-understanding wife into finger-pointing harridan. If you've read it, you know to what I'm referring.C. Harry's impersonation of a father-as-dictator (view spoiler)[that I initially attributed to the first timeturning, but as he had his come-to-Jesus before the timeline was altered again, I'm forced to conclude was simply his epically poor parenting skills. (hide spoiler)]4. Contradictions, including, but not limited to:In Act 2, when Harry uses his conversation with Dumbledore-as-portrait as reasoning for his ludicrous request, Headmistress McGonagoll admonishes him for treating a \"memoir\" like the actual person:\nHARRY: And Dumbledore\u2014Dumbledore said\u2014PROFESSOR McGONAGALL: What? HARRY: His portrait. We spoke. He said some things which made sense\u2014PROFESSOR McGONAGALL: Dumbledore is dead, Harry. And I\u2019ve told you before, portraits don\u2019t represent even half of their subjects.\nBUT, in Act 4, this:DUMBLEDORE (openly weeping now): I was blind. That is what love does. I couldn\u2019t see that you needed to hear that this closed-up, tricky, dangerous old man . . . loved you. A pause. The two men are overcome with emotion.\nEither they're two men or they're one man and a flawed copy. Pick one and stick with it, please.5. Plot holes.A. If Dolores Umbrage warded her Hogwarts office against unauthorized entry, do you really expect me to believe that (view spoiler)[Hermione wouldn't similarly ward the office of the MINISTER OF MAGIC? (hide spoiler)]B. How many times have we heard some variation of, \"Am I the only person who's read Hogwarts, a History?\"And how many of those times were specifically in reference to wards that prevented witches and wizards from magicking themselves onto Hogwarts' property? Yet suddenly and inexplicably, anyone can use the floo network to travel to any number of chimneys on the grounds.C. There was also some nonsense about Albus and Scorpius not needing to worry about a certain de-wanded Hogwarts student being harmed b/c \"the professors would never allow serious injury to occur,\" which is, simply put . . . laughable.That's not to say HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD was horrible and I hated it. It wasn't and I didn't. I even loved parts of it, Scorpius in particular. BUT. Even taking into consideration that it was a script, not a novel, it wasn't the same level of quality we've come to expect from Rowling (who, no, may not have written the thing in its entirety, but who, YES, did collaborate on and ultimately give her seal of approval for), and that is disappointing. I'm not going to bother recommending or not recommending this one--you'll either read it or you won't, and at this stage of series worship or indifference, your decision will have little to do with what I have to say about it. SO. Go forth and do what you were always going to do.",

I really hope they put this play out on dvd sometime and make it available to everyone. Although, it might be weird seeing other people playing the parts. Anyway, I loved reading about the children. I loved the friendship between Albus, Harry's son and Scorpius, Draco's son. Scorpius was the sweetest one of all, who would have thunk. I didn't like some of the parts Ron played, he seemed like an idiot but he's Ron and I love Ron. Of course most of you already know it's written in a play format. This was weird at first and then I got into it. I don't think I have ever read a play before, it seems like I would remember. This was a nice little trip down Hogwarts Lane and the little mystery/hijinks the kids get up to that brings on all kinds of issues was a cool edition. Well, not really, but you know what I mean. I loved it. I can't say that I loved everything about it and I might not have loved it if that one part didn't come into play, but who cares. I am so happy with it for what it is. I hope you all love it as much as I did and if you don't then that's okay too. \nThank you for being my light in the darkness\nMY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List",

It's 19 years later.. Are you now as you'd expected would be 10 years ago? Are your real life friends still the same 12, 15 years later?The Story is in Different form & atmosphere? YES., It's a Play..screen play - and not to mention that there's a \u2018Definitive Edition\u2019 of the play as it is just the Rehearsal Edition.. Not the Trio story rather the children's? YES. It's story of 19 years later...of the new generation..So STOP Moaning like Myrtle,It's still very faithful to the magical series..A perfect conclusion to the Symmetry* of the Epic series in the History.~~~~~~~~~~Since the Ending of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows we wanted more...One more time.Many asking too many \"What If\"..What if Harry's son end up in Slytherin?What if Ron and Hermione didn't work out as the author herself suspects?What if there's a Time Turner left?What if we use it to save someone of Death?What if we use it to save Voldemort? or to make more Horcrux ? Or worst? What if we had One More Book? Nineteenth Years Later?**The Play**--------First of all, Please do a Worldwide tour...Please include Egypt.It's easy to read, and to get into the story..Alas, I have to admit that being in form of \u2018play\u2019 and not a novel made it even a bit \u201cdry\u201d like most Fan Fictions., I even thought, after spending a direct 6 hours reading 3 Acts that it may be one and not the real deal -since I read it first in ebook format till my hard copy arrive to Egypt- Anyway, You have to use your imagination to get the scenes...recall your past experience, life in Hogwarts and you'll be easily in...Reliving the MagicAdd to being a play, it's not all by J.K. Rowling, the story is by her, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany together..And the Playwright is by Jack Thorne...not Rowling.Yet the lines are really fun, smart..just amazing.And you have to let go once you start \u2018Act Two\u2019 cause everything starts to heat up much..in a very fast packed adventure, and theatrical dramatic ones\u2026The Story--------\u201cCan you Keep the Secret?\u201dWill try my best.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~It's different... more mature...real wild and dangerous cause it deals with the most dangerous Instruments...TIME..This time you'd feel that Rowling is really cruel to the characters..It may be about the Test of Life....To Choose between what's good and what's easy..BUT it was real hard test to us all..I will merely summing up only Act One..It starts right with the \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\u201d Epilogue scene..Albus Severus Potter is worried sick he'd end up in SlythrineYet.. as soon as he started his year, this was the least of his troubles.Surprisingly befriended with Scorpius Malfoy, surprisingly hates Hogwarts\u2026Surprisingly hates being the child of The Boy Who Lived, while many died in his cause.The Father/Son issue in its worst..And before his fourth year starts..Everything happens fast\u2026Harry as Ministry official and Hermione as Minister for Magic seize an illegal last Time Turner..that even more dangerous..Amos Diggory wants his son back...who had been killed by Voldmort in the Triwizard Tournament more than 20 years ago..Albus feels his father's responsible for this death..An attempt to change a minor misfortune of the past leads into a massive , colossal damage to the present and the future..And even turns into a horrible Dystopia.It's like The Butterfly Effect\u2026 Days of Future PastAgain it's a story of the value of Friendship\u2026 The wrong of Prejudice... But it's also about Father/Son relation very well written..I loved how it goes, from wrong to kinda right.Between Harry and Albus, Between Dumbledore and Harry\u2026And even between Draco and Scorpius..Also the Marital relation is really good here\u2026I loved Ron and Hermione their opposite character yet their strong bond.And the love that lived...between Harry and Ginny.Oh and Draco and his wife\u2026Okay, time for,The Characters-----------Again... Rowling is really cruel to her characters here..Harry's being a \"Hot Head\" is clearly deepening the problem with his son.. he's always has been a hot head by the way..yet Ginny is a good mother, and better wife than I expected.Hermone was good , not excellent but I LOVED how she turned into two different characters .. one was really awesome in the Dystopia, the second was really bad...but that may match what happened.I just may be didn't like Ron much that I didn't feel angry enough for him being a bit shallow in this play but that still a bit sad.And I have to admit that I really LOVE how Draco is...with his still being have the trace of what he was before...BUT don't forget it's not about Harry Potter anymore...it's more about the Kids...Though I wished to see more of Rose who's been shallow but I just loved Albus and Scorpios..You'll be surprised with who you're gonna meet here.. truly.Some of the Characters we all love makes appearance, some of them even you may never expect to see again!!!! I have to say that I felt goosebumps everytime an old character appears...not just flashbacks, some was in The Future Past, or a real dystopia, some in dreams, even in portraits and some are just mentioned.I really loved it. And wished for even more.I was so sad for the death of some, and the re-death of some..And just remember ... when you're 40.. you don't live the adventures much as your children..And this last story is about them after all....The Children..Who's The Cursed Child-------------------As if I'm gonna tell, ha!Till the mid of the third act you'll have many suspicious.In Harry Potter\u2019s dreams here he can be The Cursed Child...-one of the best haunting scenes in every early novels was always Harry\u2019s dreams, I bet it's purely written by Rowling here-oh and looking from The Dursleys perspective, he is..even worse, he's so in his Son's eyes as well\u2026And that's what triggers everything here.Many surprises, many twists\u2026I loved it\u2026 I loved the ending as well\u2026Playing in time is dangerous and as every one since the last book asked about Why Not Using the Time Turner\u2026.here's the answer..in the last book of the Series that changed the History forever..Letting Go.------------By the end of this book you'll realize why J.K. Rowling announced that that's it for Harry Potter stories\u2026 it is the the full circle\u2026 the Beginning meets the End..the time has answered every What-if we can think of.What if we use the time Turner to...It's all here.19 Years for most of us, since the release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone in 1997...Reading the story of Harry and his friends in 7 Volumes..Reading as many lines about the back story of them and the rest of characters in the Pottermore and social media by Rowling. Craving for one more time with them...after the Epilogue that passed 19 years.Get excited with the very short article 2 years ago on Dumbledore Army reunited in the Qudditch World Cup.Now here it is, a full story, one last story full of love and nostalgia.We can't go back in time. We shan't dwell in the past..And when I finish it, 2 times, I really admit This is EVERYTHING I've ever wanted in a Harry Potter sequels but I just wish a Time Turner, back to 1997 and start reading Harry Potter all over again.... :)It's not good to dwell in past anyway, so I'm just Happy I lived this series..grown up with it..I, and many of Potterheads and fans, were worried sick it may let us down but I'm so glad that many liked it.And it's bittersweet to know that's it.BUT We must have THE \u2018Definitive Edition\u2019 of the play that promised.The series of Harry Potter, the boy who lived,is now complete\u2026And we still have a Wizarding World so vast to explore.With J.K. Rowling, our Queen of Magic.Mohammed ArabeyFrom 31 July 2016To 1 Aug. 2016**\u201c The Symmetry in case you didn't notice it yet.\u201dAnd you can really add more similarities to that .This time it's so related to the Heart of the Series,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which is heavily echoes here..If you agree about the symmetrical relation specially between this one and Goblet of Fire, let's discuss it at the comments :)",

Am I satisfied with some aspects? Absolutely. But am I disappointed as well? Unfortunately, YES.L I K E S :Characters:I was so happy to feel like the characters were authentic. Throughout the entire novel, these felt like the children I grew up alongside and their development over the last two decades into adults felt REAL. Everyone was who I wanted them to become (ESPECIALLY DRACO) and even the kid's had their own distinctive voices I really enjoyed. The dynamic of the characters (Harry & Draco are a perfect example, as well as Harry & Ginny and Ron & Hermione) were consistent with the books, yet still developed over the years into what I felt they should be. Also Scorpius is my everything, he is one of the purest characters in all of literature and if you disagree, bye.Things that were addressed that needed to be addressed:(view spoiler)[.FINALLY WE SEE HARRY SUFFERING FROM THE TRAUMA OF HIS CHILDHOOD. It bothered me to no end that in the books, the only remnants of his abuse were Harry being surprised when people were nice to him. Here, Harry is obviously suffering from flashbacks from life with the Dursley's and as much as I hate to see him in further pain, I've been wondering for years why this never came up before. Consider me satisfied.  (hide spoiler)] (view spoiler)[ HARRY CONFRONTS DUMBLEDORE ABOUT KEEPING HIM THE DARK ABOUT ALL HE KNEW. Let me start off by saying I LOVE Albus Dumbledore. He made mistakes over the years in how he approached Harry/Voldemort and what not, but overall, I think he was a great man, a talented wizard, and had a good heart despite his questionable actions. That being said, Harry did gain more nerve over the years as he was growing up, and his mini-heated moments with Dumbledore never really did the situation justice in my opinion. I'm so happy Harry finally called Dumbledore out on how little information he shared with Harry and Dumbledore was forced to respond. I really really loved this scene and I'm so glad it finally happened.  (hide spoiler)]Minimal moments that made me happy: Basically, I think there are so many people that loved everything about this book, but as I read this book very critically and found a lot of faults, the parts I loved seemed pretty minimal so I've grouped them here.-Beginning: I loved that the story started at the epilogue of Deathly Hallows. I didn't even think this was a possibility, but I think it was the perfect way to mesh these two stories into one another.- Draco & Harry's Dynamic: These two developed exactly as I wanted them to. While there is still an air of distaste around both of them, they've truly grown and come to terms with each other. (view spoiler)[ We have classic Draco/Harry like the duel in Harry's kitchen, the fact that Draco still refers to Harry as Potter, and especially that wonderful line \"Keep up old man.\" \"Draco, we're the same age. \"Well, I wear it better.\" But we also have beautiful moments like when Draco admits he was always jealous of The Golden Trio or really opens up to Harry about Astoria & wanting to protect Scorpius. It was truly one of my favorite relationships in the book and I'm ecstatic it turned out the way I wanted it to.  (hide spoiler)]-(view spoiler)[ The transition of the timeline changing was done REEAAAALLLY well. When Harry tells Albus he has to spend all of his time in the Gryffindor common room and claims \"he knows what house he is\", I was truly confused being like \"Harry Potter are you even trying to change the housing system? You're not THAT famous.\" but I very quickly realized it was the timeline slowing changing everyone but Albus/Scorpius and I thought it was a clever way to set up for the next scene of UTTER CHAOS.  (hide spoiler)]-(view spoiler)[ Albus's idea to write a message to Harry in demiguise to react with the love potion he spilled on Harry's blanket was BRILLIANT in my opinion. While I'm still questioning how they got a hold of the blanket so easily without Lily knowing, it was a very classic HP Solution moment to me, and I was super satisfied.  (hide spoiler)]Humor: I personally really enjoyed the humor in the play! The jokes coming from the cast felt really true to their characters and this book had me laughing out loud all throughout the books. I'll go over specific lines in my video review for the sake of length on here, but I don't think there was a single intentional joke that didn't have me howling of laughter.Scorpius & Albus: Okay listen, I am one to respect anyone's sexuality, so if these two claim they're straight, they're straight. But seriously, there is so much queer baiting in this script that it pains me to know it was never going to amount to anything. I don't understand why it's so bad to have two gay wizards as the main characters. If you're going to throw lines at me like \"He doesn't like his friend talking to a girl\" and \"They hug each other with fierceness. They hold for a beat.\" IMMA SHIP THEM TOGETHER. And that's not to undermine their love as friends; regardless of their sexuality, they have a beautiful relationship and their dynamic is a pleasure to read. It's clear they love each other so much, even if it is just as friends. I just think I would have loved this story on a whole 'nother level if their friendship became something more at the end of the story.D I S L I K E S :Lack of characters: This goes into my feeling that this plot was FAR TOO LARGE to be limited to the time constraints and physical space on the stage for a play. There is an absence of every character who is not Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Albus, Scorpius,and Delphi. -Hugo: Does not appear ONCE. What REALLY confuses me and goes into the contradiction to the books, is that he was at Kings Cross in the Deathly Hallows epilogue, yet he's not in the first scene. He starts Hogwarts during Albus/Scorpius/Rose's third year, yet he. is. never. there. He's Ron and Hermione's child for gods sake! He should have been in this book!- Rose, James, & Lily: While we do see these three in the beginning for a few scenes, all three are virtually absent from the entire play after about Act Two. How on earth do you expect me to believe these two groups of parents are off on another CRAZY adventure, but don't show any thought about their children, other than Albus? It's just unreasonable and does not make sense. I'm going to say this a million times throughout these reviews, but if you use the argument that \"it's a play, they don't have enough time,\" then they should not have made this story a play. Lack of room for a plot is the biggest reason to NOT include it and putting out something incomplete is just sloppy and amateur.- Neville: Neville is mentioned COUNTLESS times throughout this novel. He's a professor at Hogwarts and you bet your ass he would coddle The Golden Trio's children like they were his own, but again HE DOESN'T SHOW UP ONCE. (view spoiler)[ I mean the world literally \"rests of Neville Longbottom\" at on point, and we still don't see his as an active part of the play?  (hide spoiler)] I'm purely disappointed.- Teddy Lupin: Teddy is obviously a very minor character but HE WAS ALSO AT KINGS CROSS (which still confuses me because he had left Hogwarts at this point, but whatevs) HE WAS STILL THERE. They made a big deal that Teddy was a \"part of the Potter family\" and came over for dinner frequently, but he isn't even mentioned in the books. Also, his CHARACTER ITSELF was made a big deal by Jo, who wanted the story to end on another child being left an orphan. But nope, there's no space for anyone who wasn't a main character (which is a large fault in the author's planning because side characters are still hugely important to a story) so we don't see him at all.- Hagrid: OK WHERE THE HELL IS HAGRID. Someone suggested to me that he may have wrongfully passed, but if McGonagall is alive, I'm betting Hagrid's giant blood gives him a different lifespan than most wizards. HE WOULD LITERALLY DO ANYTHING TO SPEND TIME WITH HARRY&GINNY&RON&HERMIONE'S CHILDREN WHERE IS HE. We go through like three or four alternate timelines of Hogwarts and he is absent in all of them. Seriously, it's a straight up disservice to his character.Harry & Albus's relationship: (view spoiler)[ I really disliked how Albus treated his father. People are on here saying Harry is a terrible father, and all I can think is why none of them touch on how terrible of a son Albus was in the beginning. Albus is so angsty and resentful that his father is famous (most of which, he didn't chose to be famous for) and completely denies any effort Harry makes. Albus MOCKS HARRY OF HIS CHILDHOOD AND ABUSE. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! He makes fun of Harry for being an orphan (not his fault) and being abused by the Dursley's (not his fault.) Yes, Harry's response was not okay either. But we have YEARS of Harry attempting to help Albus and connect with him that fall to pieces with one comment. We also have years of Albus treating Harry like shit. It took me a really long time to like Albus because of this, and I'm glad the ending implies that they are finally starting to connect with each other and build a better relationship, the beginning of this novel was painful to read because of it.  (hide spoiler)]The scene in the Ministry: okay I got a looooooot of issues here. 1. (view spoiler)[ Hermione, the goddamn Minister of Magic, would allow her office to be opened with a simple \"Alohomora\"? Preposterous.  (hide spoiler)]2. (view spoiler)[ THIS WHOLE BOOKCASE PLOT IS SO STUPID. Why on earth would she leave a trail of riddles leading to the time turner if A. No one but herself and select Ministry employees are meant to know about it. B. WHY WOULD THE RIDDLES ACTUALLY LEAD TO THE DAMN TIME TURNER!? In previous HP riddles (i.e. Sorcerer's Stone & Goblet of Fire), the riddles are meant to be tests to prove if you are worthy enough to move on. The riddles here are meant as \"protection\", yet it doesn't protect them at all, it literally leads anyone who could figure it out RIGHT TO WHAT SHE WAS HIDING. Hermione knows where she hid it, she wouldn't need to go through the same scavenger hunt over and over again when she wants to retrieve it. The protection should have made it IMPOSSIBLE for anyone unwanted to find it. I despise the idea that the brightest witch of her age and the most (politically) powerful witch in Britian would so poorly protect a highly dangerous and illegal object.  (hide spoiler)]THE TIME TURNERS:Oh lordy, lordy. Prepare for the longest rant of this entire review. 1. To give you a run down, the system of time travel established in Prisoner of Azkaban is essentially a \"fixed timeline\" meaning that the time traveler's actions would not alter the timeline at all. (ex. it's Harry who creates the Patronus to save himself & Sirius because as Harry himself claims \"It was easy, because I'd already done it.) In Harry Potter & The Cursed Child, it follows the timeline known as the \"Grandfather Paradox\" (aka used in Back to the Future) which is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEM OF TIME that is more flexible and allows people to change history by their actions. YOU. CAN'T. HAVE. TWO. DIFFERENT. SYSTEMS. OF. TIME. It's made clear that creating a paradox is possible in POA (an example given is that one can kill their future/past self if they are recognized by themselves), but that doesn't change that fact that there is no evidence of the fixed timeline that has been established for 12 years in TCC. Paradoxes fucking everywhere and The Doctor is sobbing from his Tardis.2. (view spoiler)[ It's stated in this book that the time turner Albus & Scorpius use DOES allow them to go back further than hours. (If you didn't know, time turners are virtually an encased HOUR reversal charm. Using a regular time turner, Albus, Scorpius, and Delphi would have had to turn the object over 200,000 times to go back to the TriWizard Tournament.) Since it's established that it's different, we are never told how it actually works? Do we still twist it back to choose how far we want? Is it a yearly-reversal charm now? (which also doesn't make sense, see point #3) You can't introduce an entirely new magical object without giving any explanation. If Prisoner of Azkaban can teach us about time turners in a 2 1/2 hour movie, The Cursed Child could explain how this new one works in a 3 hour play. There's literally no excuse for this gigantic piece of missing information. And again, if you think \"they didn't have enough time in the play to explain it,\" IT. SHOULD. NOT. BE. INCLUDED.  (hide spoiler)]3. (view spoiler)[ Since when do time turners allow you to pick the exact date & time you want to arrive in time at???????? They travel back to tasks #1 and #2 of the TriWizard tournament at LEAST twice over the course of MULTIPLE days, meaning they don't need to be on the exact date they want to travel 23 years back. They somehow have the ability to pick the DAY, YEAR, AND TIME they want to travel to with ZERO explanation. For a prototype, that's pretty extensive, and most likely, IMPOSSIBLE.  (hide spoiler)]4. On Pottermore, (here's an image as a source https://twitter.com/LIBassBunny/statu... - the original post I found it from is from 3 years ago) J.K. Rowling admits that she left a ton of plot holes in the system of time travel she created. She claims to have fixed that over the years, ending the solution with destroying all of them during the battle at the Department of Mysteries. And I think this is great, this is what authors should have the incentive to do when they make a mistake. BUT if she wanted to fix it, why would she approve a script that is built on the foundation of something she tried to erase in her books? It truly makes me question either how genuine her approval is, or the integrity of her character to turn her back on her previous decisions.To sum up, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child BUTCHERED the system of time & time travel created by Jo and I have no words to describe how detrimental this is to the plot.Big secret plot twist I don't want to spoil: (view spoiler)[ BELLATRIX WAS PREGNANT WITH VOLDEMORT'S CHILD, ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?? THIS IS RIDICULOUS. 1. Not only is it upsetting to me because I always imagined Voldemort to be asexual in a sense because human emotions other than hatred, like love and happiness and lust always seemed so beneath him (Yes, lust is a human emotion, for the most part. Humans and other mammals are virtually the only species that have sex for pleasure and not strictly procreation.) So first of all, I'm amazed Voldemort having sex is even canon.  (hide spoiler)]2. (view spoiler)[ We see Bellatrix Lestrange throughout her pregnancy during the books, despite her never being pregnant???? I'm gonna assume here that wizard pregnancy is the same as muggle pregnancy and she would carry her child for 9 months. In Deathly Hallows, we see Belltrix at the beginning of the book (July 1997) at Malfoy Manor, and later we see her at Malfoy Manor after Harry breaks into Gringotts (May 1998). She is not pregnant in the books at either of these times. Yes, that's 11 months and she CONVENIENTLY could have brought her pregnancy to term within those 11 months we don't see her. But when something is this conveniently timed after the fact, it destroys all evidence to realism to me.  (hide spoiler)]3. (view spoiler)[ With the Malfoy Manor being basically Death Eater HQ at this time, I'd like to think Bellatrix spent a lot of time there surrounded by Death Eaters. ARE YOU TELLING ME NO ONE NOTICED SHE WAS FUCKING PREGNANT?! I guess we apparently now have a spell to reduce a baby bump or some other convenient explanation here.  (hide spoiler)]4. (view spoiler)[ To go along with #3, Draco LIVES at Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix was definitely there multiple times over the 11 months. Bellatrix is his aunt, whom I would assume he would see more than other Death Eaters considering she and her mother always seemed relatively close. Are you trying to tell me one of the main characters from this story would just \"happen\" to not see/forget his aunt's pregnancy happening in his own home, right under his nose?  (hide spoiler)]This is ridiculous. This is far too convenient. There is too little information on when this actually happened. I refuse to accept this as part of the plot.Random little things that bother me:- First trip back in time: (view spoiler)[ Albus asks if they're certain the dragon won't kill Cedric without his wand, Delphi replies \"This is Hogwarts. They won't let damage happen to any of the champions.\" YOU REALIZE YOU ARE THERE BECAUSE A BOY ACTUALLY DIED IN THIS COMPETITION AND YOU ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THAT. YOU ARE LITERALLY IN 1994 STANDING WHERE YOU ARE BECAUSE A CHAMPION DIED. LIKE WHO LET THIS LINE PASS THROUGH EDITING!?!?!  (hide spoiler)]-The Trolley Witch: (view spoiler)[ Okay serious what was this nonsense. Absolutely ridiculous. I have no idea who's executive decision this was, but it was terrible. This is the wizarding world. We could have had a much better and fitting obstacle to prevent Albus & Scorpius from jumping off the train. I couldn't even laugh at it's ridiculousness because I was cringing too hard.  (hide spoiler)]T H I N G S T H A T M A D E M E C R Y :-Harry in Godric's Hollow: (view spoiler)[ I have seen the deaths of Lily and James Potter quite a few times throughout the series, but nothing compares to the pain of watching Harry have to watch. As much as this hurt me, I think it was a wonderful addition to the play.  (hide spoiler)]-Hagrid meeting Harry for the first time: (view spoiler)[ \"My name is Rubeus Hagrid, and I'm going to be your friend whether you like it or not.\" Tears. No explanation neeed.  (hide spoiler)]-Draco opening up to Harry: (view spoiler)[ When Draco visits Harry at work and they talk about their sons, Astoria's death, and Draco's life, I was a mess. \"It is exceptionally lonely being Draco Malfoy\" hit me SOOO hard. I also love how much Draco loves Astoria and Scorpius. I just thought this scene was so deep and true and I'm forever grateful we got to see it.  (hide spoiler)]There are a million more things to say in my video review, so stay tuned for that on my YouTube channel. All in all, I'm happy we got this book. I'm happy I read it. I'm happy that some things stayed true and somethings impressed me. But I'm super disappointed that it's so dissociated from the rest of the books plot-wise and that it was very underdeveloped. I will stand by my opinion that this should have been a full novelization of the play, and that would have fixed a lot of the inconsistencies and plot holes. I will absolutely go to see this play when it hits New York, and I would recommend it to any Harry Potter fan.",
            "[.FINALLY WE SEE HARRY SUFFERING FROM THE TRAUMA OF HIS CHILDHOOD. It bothered me to no end that in the books, the only remnants of his abuse were Harry being surprised when people were nice to him. Here, Harry is obviously suffering from flashbacks from life with the Dursley's and as much as I hate to see him in further pain, I've been wondering for years why this never came up before. Consider me satisfied.  (hide spoiler)]",
            "[ HARRY CONFRONTS DUMBLEDORE ABOUT KEEPING HIM THE DARK ABOUT ALL HE KNEW. Let me start off by saying I LOVE Albus Dumbledore. He made mistakes over the years in how he approached Harry/Voldemort and what not, but overall, I think he was a great man, a talented wizard, and had a good heart despite his questionable actions. That being said, Harry did gain more nerve over the years as he was growing up, and his mini-heated moments with Dumbledore never really did the situation justice in my opinion. I'm so happy Harry finally called Dumbledore out on how little information he shared with Harry and Dumbledore was forced to respond. I really really loved this scene and I'm so glad it finally happened.  (hide spoiler)]",
            "[ We have classic Draco/Harry like the duel in Harry's kitchen, the fact that Draco still refers to Harry as Potter, and especially that wonderful line \"Keep up old man.\" \"Draco, we're the same age. \"Well, I wear it better.\" But we also have beautiful moments like when Draco admits he was always jealous of The Golden Trio or really opens up to Harry about Astoria & wanting to protect Scorpius. It was truly one of my favorite relationships in the book and I'm ecstatic it turned out the way I wanted it to.  (hide spoiler)]",
            "[ The transition of the timeline changing was done REEAAAALLLY well. When Harry tells Albus he has to spend all of his time in the Gryffindor common room and claims \"he knows what house he is\", I was truly confused being like \"Harry Potter are you even trying to change the housing system? You're not THAT famous.\" but I very quickly realized it was the timeline slowing changing everyone but Albus/Scorpius and I thought it was a clever way to set up for the next scene of UTTER CHAOS.  (hide spoiler)]",
            "[ Albus's idea to write a message to Harry in demiguise to react with the love potion he spilled on Harry's blanket was BRILLIANT in my opinion.

            "\u2022 review also posted on Wordpress! \u2022 Warning: This review contains major spoilers! Don\u2019t read this if you haven\u2019t read the Harry Potter series and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child yet!-------------------------------------If you loved Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, I wouldn\u2019t recommend reading my review. This is going to be a rant! You\u2019ve been warned!-------------------------------------This is the very first time I have rated a book one stars! Believe me, I don\u2019t want to do this, but I really didn\u2019t enjoy reading Cursed Child. Before I get started, I want you to know the following: 1. A couple of weeks ago, I read some spoilers from people who had watched the play. Those immediately lowered my expectations. I knew going into this I wasn\u2019t going to like it. 2. I knew this was not written by J.K. Rowling. 3. I knew this wasn\u2019t the eight book, but the script for the play.I love the Harry Potter series so much. And I always will. It means a lot to me and when I heard about this, I immediately pre-ordered it. I\u2019ve seen some people say \u2018it\u2019s Harry Potter so obviously I love this\u2019, but I can\u2019t say the same. Call me critical but I spent money on this. People spend money on tickets to go see the play. I expect something decent in return then.To call this fanfiction is an insult to all the people who try to bring more joy to a fandom. The Cursed Child was just plain bad writing. I will get into detail later, but I refuse to accept what happened as canon. I don\u2019t care what J.K. Rowling says. This is a disgrace to the characters and the people who loved the original book series. You might think that I\u2019m taking this too seriously, but they shouldn\u2019t ask money for this if it were \u2018just for fun\u2019. This is literally being promoted as \u2018the eight story\u2019 in the Harry Potter series. I knew before I started it that it wasn\u2019t, but the marketing team pretends it is.So no, I won\u2019t apologise for being critical. Just because this isn\u2019t a book, but a play, doesn\u2019t mean that the story shouldn\u2019t be as good. In fact, that is such an insult to plays! It\u2019s just another form of media. I\u2019ve seen some people say: \u201cYou can\u2019t judge this if you haven\u2019t seen the play\u201d. Well, if that\u2019s the case, they shouldn\u2019t have published it as a book. I can\u2019t afford going to London and paying a lot of money in order for some people to validate my opinion.Let\u2019s start of with the things I did like:This felt as if I was reading a book. It didn\u2019t take time to adjust to the format. I\u2019m also curious to see what everything is going to look like in the actual play. But, since I really don\u2019t like the actual story and what they did to the characters, I\u2019m not sure yet whether I\u2019d be willing to pay money for that.Out of all the characters, Hermione was the only one who still resembled who she used to be. I\u2019m proud that she has become Minister for Magic! I also really liked Minerva! And Draco proved he was a good parent (much better than Harry\u2026).I enjoyed the interactions between Albus and Scorpius! They\u2019re such good \u2018friends\u2019 (A.K.A. boyfriends).That was it. Those were the only thing I like. My list of dislikes is much longer! I had six full pages of notes. When I read a book that\u2019s over a thousand pages long, I don\u2019t even have that many notes! Let\u2019s get started:The plot is basically 90% about trying to bring back Cedric Diggory. I don\u2019t understand why Albus is so obsessed with Cedric. So many people died for Harry, why does it have to be Cedric? Obviously because Amos asked, but to have almost the entire plot of this play resolve around that\u2026I\u2019d rather read every single second of a class taught at Hogwarts! Because this wasn\u2019t magical enough. Sure, it features the characters we know and love and Hogwarts, but we rarely get to see actual magic. When Albus, Delphi and Scorpius are searching for the Time Turner in Hermione\u2019s office, they don\u2019t even try \u2018accio\u2019! Instead, they search the entire bookcase! Whenever we do get some magic, it isn\u2019t explained enough. Why couldn\u2019t Delphi use \u2018imperio\u2019 on Albus? She said: \u201cto fulfil the prophecy [\u2026] Imperio just won\u2019t do\u201d. Why not? Or when Harry transfigured into Voldemort\u2026 Is that even possible? Why would wizards go through the trouble of brewing polyjuice potion then? All of this is just very convenient, but didn\u2019t make enough sense.One of the things that bothered me most, was Ron Weasley\u2019s characterisation. He has become a caricature of the person he used to be. The only reason he\u2019s there, is for comic relief. All he does is eat and make stupid jokes. They act as if he\u2019s so dumb and doesn\u2019t take anything serious. Did Thorne actually read the original series before he wrote this? Because this is not the Ron I know! I refuse to believe that he was so drunk at his own wedding he doesn\u2019t remember anything. And why would Ron give someone love potion? He had a terrible experience with it when he was a teenager, why in the world would he do that? It doesn\u2019t make any sense!Another character who was completely butchered was Cedric Diggory. In the alternate universe where he lost the Triwizard Tournament, he becomes a death-eater and kills Neville. Cedric was one of the kindest characters. It\u2019s absurd to assume that he would become a racist murderer just because he got humiliated!Scorpius said: \u201cCedric was a different person entirely \u2013 dark, dangerous\u201d. We only found out that he killed Neville, but Scorpius didn\u2019t interact with him. I don\u2019t understand where this observation comes from. And I had that feeling quite a few times while reading this; as if I had skipped a couple of pages without realising it.Harry Potter is a terrible father. I didn\u2019t like him once in this \u2018book\u2019. Granted, Albus is a whiny teenager: he has no idea how privileged he is. Don\u2019t tell me he doesn\u2019t get special treatment because he\u2019s a Potter. A lot of people have it worse than him. Still, Harry had no right to say the things he did. And his excuse? He didn\u2019t have a father figure growing up. He had plenty! What about Arthur, Sirius, Remus, Hagrid and even Dumbledore, Harry?! Harry had no right to attack Minerva either. Just because a woman doesn\u2019t have children, doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t able to take care of them. She\u2019d be a much better parent than he ever was.And when did he become a psychic? His scar hurts, he actually hears Voldemort\u2019s voice and can speak Parseltongue again, but Delphi hadn\u2019t even saved Voldemort yet (actually, she never does). How is he able to do that if nothing has changed? Voldemort wasn\u2019t back, yet he acted as if he was? Once again, I just don\u2019t understand\u2026Also, what is up with Lily\u2019s blanket? I don\u2019t remember him ever talking about it in the books, yet now Harry pretends as if it\u2019s his most precious possession in the entire world. I know he didn\u2019t possess it in the other books, but it\u2019s still strange that he\u2019s so obsessed with it now.Oh, and the special privileges? Harry is at Hogwarts all the damn time! I don\u2019t remember parents being allowed there. I guess being a Potter does mean you\u2019re allowed to do more than others.A lot of people hate Severus Snape and don\u2019t see him as a brave person. While I don\u2019t feel as strongly about that as them, I completely understand why they feel that was. He was horrible to his pupils, particularly Hermione, Harry and Neville. But, in the alternative universe, Hermione and Ron secretly work together with him. He used to be so mean to them, it seems highly unlikely to me they would forgive him! Just because he didn\u2019t turn out to be a death-eater, doesn\u2019t mean it justifies his behaviour. Snape\u2019s interactions with Scorpius were so cringe-worthy. He isn\u2019t a nice guy who makes one or two jokes and he\u2019d never talk that openly about Lily.Because so many characters felt differently, I didn\u2019t care about them anymore. When Hermione and Ron sacrificed themselves and received the dementor\u2019s kiss, I felt nothing. On the one hand, I\u2019m sad we didn\u2019t get to see Sirius, Remus, Tonks an Teddy. But on the other hand, I\u2019m very glad, since their characters would have been butchered as well!This book almost pretends as if the other Potter and Granger-Weasley kids don\u2019t exist. Ever heard of Hugo???The timeline is so strange. Page 22 and a year has past. Page 27 and they\u2019re already starting their third year at Hogwarts. Seven pages later, another year has past! Surely, they could have given us a glimpse at their lives at Hogwarts without having to do it like this. Later on, Scorpius and Albus are in Scotland, without any brooms or wands. Yet the very next page, they\u2019re already in Godric\u2019s Hollow! How is that even possible? Again, this is not explained.And how did Albus and Scorpius know every single detail from what went down over twenty years ago at the Triwizard Tournament and Battle of Hogwarts? Did their parents tell them literally everything? Were very detailed books written? I need to know this!In the alternate universe, they kept mentioning an \u2018Augurey\u2019 and I had no idea what it meant. It\u2019s only explained many scenes later. I cannot stress enough how underdeveloped some plots were. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on because things weren\u2019t explained well enough. And that causes plot holes.I\u2019m so thankful they didn\u2019t use the Time Turner often in the Harry Potter series. I can already imagine how how things would have ended otherwise: Harry would have gone back in time and kill Voldemort and save James and Lily. Whenever a universe has the ability to time travel, that\u2019s the kind of things that happen. It\u2019s predictable. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is about. They go back in time over FOUR TIMES just to go back to how things were at the beginning of the play. It\u2019s such a waste of time. I can think of so many plots that would have been more interesting. Imagine there\u2019s ever going to be a F.R.I.E.N.D.S movie and it turns out Monica has left Chandler and never wants to see her children again. That wouldn\u2019t make any sense at all. But that is how Cursed Child feels like to me.Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my favourite books an films, so I obviously have no problems with time travelling. But this was just too much.As I\u2019ve mentioned before, I really missed the magic. And of course the characters, because Cursed Child completely butchered them. Think of how much better this would be if it was about one school year at Hogwarts, without Voldemort trying to kill everyone. Just one year of the adventures Scorpius and Albus encounter. There didn\u2019t need to be this much family drama. Honestly, I\u2019m pretty sure this was the script of a Days of Our Lives or The Bold and the Beautiful episode instead! Just think how they could have explored the other houses, besides Gryffindor! But no, in Cursed Child, everyone is still prejudiced towards Slytherins and they pretend Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff don\u2019t even exist!This is only about three hundred pages long, yet it was so repetitive. Scorpius and Albus do something stupid; Draco, Harry and Ginny run after them and need Hermione because \u201ctheir children are missing!\u201d AGAIN!I also had some problems with the writing itself: Voldemort Day? \u2018Oh Potter\u2019 instead of \u2018Oh Shit\u2019? Mudbloods in the dungeons? The Blood Ball? WE GET IT, VOLDEMORT IS BACK! \u201cA Malfoy who may be a Voldemort\u201d Euhm, that\u2019s just awful writing. \u2018Voldemort\u2019 isn\u2019t a last name; it\u2019s not as if \u2018Lord\u2019 was his first name. It should have been \u2018Riddle\u2019 instead. \u2018Thank Dumbledore\u2019 instead of \u2018Thank God\u2019 is not only cheesy, it is also incredibly arrogant. I\u2019m not the most religious person but to say that Dumbledore is a God\u2026 It\u2019s so sexist that at the Triwizard Tournament, every school got a lot of cheers besides Beauxbatons! I know boys also attend it, but it\u2019s still more \u2018feminine\u2019 than Durmstrang or Hogwarts.Almost everyone who has read this, can\u2019t deny there is something going on between Albus and Scorpius. They are so gay! But of course, this book is heteronormative to the max! I can already hear J.K. Rowling in a couple of years: \u201cActually, they were dating, but it wasn\u2019t important to the story\u201d. Please don\u2019t give this woman any praise when it comes to diversity, she doesn\u2019t deserve it. The Cursed Child could have meant a great deal more if they weren\u2019t so afraid to include characters who aren\u2019t straight for a change. And don\u2019t even get me started on Albus\u2019 crush on Delphi. He\u2019s like fourteen and she was twenty? That\u2019s disgusting.Which brings me to Delphi, the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix. Do you really expect me to believe that Voldemort was capable of love and lust? Why do they feel the need to establish that every character is \u2018oh so straight\u2019?! Supposedly, Bellatrix gave birth to Delphi before the Battle of Hogwarts in Malfoy Manor. WHAT?! In Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows, we actually see her there! Don\u2019t you think anyone would have noticed? DRACO ACTUALLY LIVED THERE! How oblivious is he supposed to be then? This doesn\u2019t make any sense!I could go on, but I think I\u2019ve made my point. There were so many things that bothered me and I don\u2019t ever want to read this again. I regret paying this much money for it. I refuse to accept this as canon. I will pretend this doesn\u2019t exist. ",

It was everything I could have hoped for and\u00a0not at all what I was expecting - seriously, not\u00a0at all - but it was perfect. \u00a0It was the type of story I play within my head when I have too much time on my hands. I was super lucky to be able to go into the story completely spoiler free and it definitely enhanced the twists and just everything.I'm not going to comment on the plot or characters. I want others who wish\u00a0to go in blind like I did to have that\u00a0chance, and I don't want to be the one\u00a0who spoils it for them.Instead, I'm going to talk about feelings.I remember the sinking sensation\u00a0I had right after finishing\u00a0Deathly Hallows for the first time - though that was enhanced by a combination of no sleep (midnight release party) and also being an eighteen-year-old-girl who just had her emotions ripped out and then torn apart by the lovely Ms Rowling. It lasted for days. It was a unique experience\u00a0to have grown up with Harry and be just a year older than\u00a0him during the Battle of Hogwarts. The end of\u00a0Deathly Hallows essentially marked the end of my childhood.Now, I'm a twenty-seven-year-old and those feelings have been ripped to shreds yet again.Post Potter Depression.But it's worth it.Harry Potter has always been the most important book series to me since I first read them in 1999\u00a0- I reread the books every year, sometimes more because of reasons - so\u00a0I'll gladly take the punches Rowling continues to throw at me.Worth it.(Book Depository / Amazon US / Amazon Canada / Amazon UK)",

Nice Natalie: What are you, narrating a movie? Don't scare them. All major spoilers are hidden, but really, we recommend going into The Cursed Child blind. Drop by after you finish!Cynical Natalie: Alright, let's get down to it. What the flip did we just read? Nice Natalie: A lovely story about family and threads we didn't know needed to be tied up, but made perfect sense when we read it. I always thought Harry was a little too caviler after the Battle of Hogwarts finished. We finally get to see the guilt-ridden PTSD part. Cynical Natalie: Stop dancing around the question like One Direction asked about Zayn's departure. You know what I'm talking about. (view spoiler)[Bellatrix and Voldemort's daughter. (hide spoiler)] The brainchild of fanfiction writers.Nice Natalie: I admit it was a weak plot element, but I liked the parallel. The Cursed Child is ultimately about family and Harry connecting with his son. (view spoiler)[You can't say you didn't feel a little bit sad when Delphi finally thought she was meeting her father. She must have had a lonely childhood\u2014like Harry. I bet if she looked in the Mirror of Erised, she'd see the same thing he did. (hide spoiler)]Cynical Natalie: Hooray for literature class. But that element is so full of plot holes, logic runs clean through. (view spoiler)[Bellatrix wasn't pregnant in the Deathly Hallows.Nice Natalie: Rowling didn't plan on writing an eighth story then. And pregnancies in the Wizarding world might work differently. She might have used dark magic to speed up the terms and replenish her body right before the Battle of Hogwarts. You don't know that.Cynical Natalie: I know it's ludicrous. Given that I accept your tissue-thin rationale, Delphi is a sorry, one-dimensional excuse for a villain. Nice Natalie: Time constraints. Rowling didn't have seven books this time. (hide spoiler)]Nice Natalie: Can't you focus on the good for once? What about the trick Albus and Scorpius used to send for help? That's old-school Rowling at her best, disguising useful plot objects as the mundane in the beginning and then whipping them out like a boss further down the line.Cynical Natalie: Because there's too much bad to focus on the good! Like why is Albus such a fucking idiot? (Those who want to go in the Cursed Child completely blind might want to avert your eyes) Why would he attempt to go back in time and save Cedric? Screwing with time is a bad idea, especially during a period so entwined with Voldemort's existence. Nice Natalie: I've had a lot of time to think about that. Remember that interview with Rowling? She said she deliberately smashed all the Time-Turners in Order of the Phoenix, so characters couldn't go back and mess with her plotlines. At the same time, she had Hermione drill into Harry and Ron\u2014and by extension, us\u2014that fiddling with the past was a bad idea. Albus missed that lesson. He doesn't know the dangers of playing with time. When he made that decision, he was extremely angry with his dad and got a bit reckless. Like father, like son. Harry used to do reckless stuff when he was mad too, like diving into Snape's thoughts or going off to find Marvolo's ring.I think if it were in book format, we would've gotten a deeper insight into Albus's thought process and rationalized his behavior, like we always did with Harry's.Cynical Natalie: You're so far up Harry's ass, you can't even see straight.The Cursed Child kinda makes me hate Harry. He abused his authority and position. Teenager Harry would've hated him.Nice Natalie: He never claimed to be perfect. And that moment you're talking about was after Albus and Scorpius went dickering around in the past. It had to have caused ripples in his personality.Cynical Natalie: While we're talking about the first altered timeline, I can't believe my intelligent, level-headed Hermione turned into a bitter spinster just because she and Ron didn't get married. Nice Natalie: I didn't read it like that. I read it as a Ron/Hermione moment. She needs Ron's humor to balance out her stuffy side and Ron needs someone who will understand him on Hermione's level.Cynical Natalie: Oh, I didn't realize Ron mattered anymore. Because he's clearly been downgraded to the comic relief character. One of the main themes of the original series was to show Ron was more than a sidekick. He was his own person, brave and loyal, and deserves to stand in the light instead of the shadows of his friends.Nice Natalie: Again, I read it as far more positive. Ron isn't the insecure teenager he was anymore. He has nothing to prove, not to himself, not to anyone else. He's comfortable on the sidelines. After all, according to Rowling, this is the guy who resigned from his job as an Auror to run a joke shop.His role during the climax was beautiful. (view spoiler)[Harry chooses to stay behind to witness his parents' death and Ron says, \"We'll watch with you.\" That's him; that's the youngest male Weasley to the letter. (hide spoiler)]Cynical Natalie: There are still a lot of inconsistencies. Why is McGonagall the headmaster? Rowling said she \"getting on a bit\" in an interview and Hogwarts got a new headmaster after the Battle.Nice Natalie: She probably didn't want so many new characters. That's partially why Luna, Teddy Lupin, and most of the Weasleys didn't show up. Let it go, will you? It's a tiny thing.Cynical Natalie: Fine. What about\u2014to quote the fine folks over on Twitter\u2014the gay panic with Albus and Scorpius?We're not the kind of people read homoerotic subtext in everything. We didn't see it with Naruto/Sasuke and we don't see it with Dean and Castiel from Supernatural. It's not until others pointed it out that we saw potential signs. But the sexual tension between Albus and Scorpius was off the charts. I was shipping them from day one. And the shit Rowling has them say... My God.Snape's famous declaration and \"They belong together\"\u2014Right, absolutely platonic.Nice Natalie: Rowling probably wanted to go for a Lily/James parallel with Rose and Scorpius. You can't please all the shippers.Beside, like you can hate anything that has to do with Harry Potter.Cynical Natalie: ...Nice Natalie: Right?Cynical Natalie: ...I hate you.Nice Natalie: But you don't hate Harry.Cynical Natalie: This is a sentimental rating, not a logical one.Nice Natalie: We read on emotion, darling.Cynical Natalie: Fuck off.Other Nice Natalie/Cynical Natalie brawls reviews:The Fault in Our StarsA Girl Like YouIf I StayDreams of Gods & MonstersThe MartianMe and Earl and the Dying GirlCatching FireAll The RageAn Ember In The AshesThe Hammer of ThorThe Ship of the DeadCaravalWarcrossThe Last Namsara",

This book is truly disappointing. The plot is ridiculous and the characters feels so...strange. They're not acting like themselves. I'm questioning Harry Potter's behavior. He turned into an insensitive and arrogant guy. Regardless he's a father, this is not the Harry Potter I knew from books 1-7. He matured a lot from those books and learned from many people in his life including Albus Dumbledore, Hagrid, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin etc... I don't like Albus Severus. He's a reckless, ungrateful, stupid idiot.

Harry's son, Albus, is an outcast--everything Harry isn't, in a bad way, and the two struggle to relate until Albus becomes so isolated he starts falling down the same path that Voldemort did. And then there's Draco's son, always around, leading Albus down the wrong path, bringing up bad-blood from the past, and helping Albus make monstrous mistakes--all while having a personality that's sure to win you over.",

            "I had been eagerly awaiting Harry Potter and the Cursed Child when I found out that the play would be released in book form. There was a time when I got a new Potter book on my hands and would stay up all night reading. Now let us fast forward 19 years, or in my case, nine years later. Three of my four kids read Harry Potter books, two of them have completed the series twice and the third is currently on book four. No longer can I get Harry Potter from the library and be guaranteed of being the first to read it. That being said, I was determined to read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child before my kids got their hands on it; I easily finished in a few hours and rate this play 3.5 stars. I am sure this fan fiction version of nineteen years later was magical on the stage. As a book, however, I was left wanting more. I have read the series countless times and, still believe that reading JK Rowling's masterpiece is like apple pie a la mode, the ultimate comfort food. While it was pleasant to re-enter Harry's world, Rowling ended the series in a perfect place. The fact that I still want to read it from time to time is testament to its lasting legacy. Perhaps, if I was nineteen years younger, having started reading about Harry as a child rather than a college graduate, I would be more thrilled by this story. When all is said and done, this play is fan fiction. I might not have loved it as much as the original books, but I am guessing that the kids of Albus' and Scorpius' generation will enjoy it just the same. A fun read for a summer's day but I would still prefer to stay up late with a copy of the original books.",

Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses.And yet . . .As in all wars, life goes on. The Weasley twins expand their business. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate - and lose a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, through Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.So it's the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here at Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complete story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort - and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability.",

It's always delightful to see, everything that was great about the series still remains the same, if not better. However, disappointments, sorrow and hardships are what the reader is going to encounter for the most part. As I finished reading Half-Blood Prince, more than ever before, I feel being trapped in a hopeless situation filled with nothing but forebodings.\"Destination...determination...deliberation...\"One would imagine, we're beyond being accommodated with new characters, but the author will quickly convince you otherwise, and introduction of new and interesting characters continues. It's great to see how Rowling keeps outperforming herself with each new book . Harry's ill-tempered nature and suspicions does not end with the last book as I hoped it would, but the results are quite the opposite this time around. Honestly, I did not anticipate the way how things turned out right till the last three chapters.\"To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!We've been somewhat used to happy ending in the first four books (relatively) with 5th being a bit disappointing but this one, it was the most depressing ending for me yet. It probably comes down to reinforcing the suspense toward the final book but, it's a difficult place to be in - especially if you had to wait for a year..\"Eet 'as been too long!\"",

            "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter #6), J.K. Rowling Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the Harry Potter series. Set during protagonist Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury, and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries.Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, with his Death Eaters kidnapping wand-maker Garrick Ollivander from Diagon Alley and destroying the Millennium Bridge. The Malfoy family is disgraced when Lucius is apprehended and sent to Azkaban for his involvement with the Death Eaters. Voldemort instead chooses Draco to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco's mother Narcissa and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek help from Severus Snape, who claims to have been acting as a mole within the Order of the Phoenix all along. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.Harry Potter, now 16 years old, accompanies Albus Dumbledore from Surbiton to the village of Budleigh Babberton to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Slughorn, who has been in hiding, agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to The Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The three visit Fred and George Weasley's new joke shop at Diagon Alley and see Draco entering Knockturn Alley with a group of Death Eaters including Fenrir Greyback. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry hides in the Slytherin carriage using his Invisibility Cloak, but is spotted and petrified by Malfoy. \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u067e

            "I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children\u2019s Lit class in college. I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn\u2019t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn\u2019t have been willing to admit in college that I\u2019m perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she\u2019s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it\u2019s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain\u2019s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don\u2019t know what these are.Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort\u2019s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (\u201cmuggle\u201d in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry).(Faulkner anyone?)But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother\u2019s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the \u201cmuggle\u201d blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents\u2019 death.With Dumbledore\u2019s help in exploring Voldemort\u2019s past, Harry begins to understand that he\u2019s come to be where he is through the choices he\u2019s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that\u2019s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort\u2019s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?",

            "Here's the thing about the Harry Potter books...They're awesome.Deep, huh? Well, deep or shallow, it's the truth. I waited a long time to read the Harry Potter books because I wanted to experience them with my own children. My son (8) and I just finished the sixth book, my first daughter (6) and I are working on the first, and my youngest child (3) is content to commandeer her siblings' wands and run around shrieking, \"I have a Harry Potter stick!\"In other words, we all enjoy it.I could write a great deal about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, but it's a tough book to write about without giving things away. And though I loved this novel for many reasons, I find it quite difficult to separate it from the other tales. This, I think, speaks to J.K. Rowling's ability to connect the stories in a such a way that they each have their own identity while still continuing to trace a gigantic glowing arc through the sky along which the reader is able to ride from the first book to the seventh.So before I tell you a few things I loved about the novel, please know that there might be spoilers below. Not huge spoilers, mind you, but I'm always afraid of letting something slip. So...be forewarned. Don't read on if you haven't read this book yet. And if you haven't read the book, why are you reading a review of it by a writer whose skills don't yet approach J.K. Rowling's? Seriously. Get off the danged Internet and read this amazing series!Some delights and terrors and sorrows...1. Fenrir Greyback: Bet that surprised you a little. I know that this character played a relatively minor role, but on the page he was a scene-stealer, a flesh-chewer, and a perfect foil for one of my favorite characters, Remus Lupin.An aside: About a year before I began reading the series, my Creative Writing class was discussing characterization. The kids began talking about the Harry Potter books. One remarked that the supporting characters were as interesting as the leads, which led another student to bring up Remus Lupin. She was halfway through her cataloging of his merits as a character when she stopped and looked up at me, as if seeing me anew. She then said, \"Mr. (Insert real name here). You sort of remind me of Lupin.\" When I later found out he was a werewolf, I was a little bit shocked (and secretly pleased). But when I really got to know the character, I found the remark incredibly gratifying.Back to Fenrir Greyback (with whom I hope I have nothing in common)...What made Greyback so incredibly interesting to me was not only the sheer ferocity of his behavior, but the diabolical simplicity of his motives. If the Harry Potter books were likened to Lord of the Flies and Voldemort's ambition were compared with Jack's (the leader of the hunters), then Greyback would be Roger, the sadist. This powderkeg of a character lives only to rend flesh and to guzzle the steaming lifeblood of his victims. Greyback doesn't want to rule the world; he simply wants to terrorize it. I don't know what kind of a role he plays in the seventh book (if any), but his unreasoning brutality added just the right note of menace to a book that largely---and sensitively---focused on the romantic relationships of its teenagers.2. Fleur's Surprising Reaction: I admit to falling prey to a stupid prejudice here, and I feel awful about it. But I wrongly assumed Fleur Delacour was a pretty face without a soul. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire she was the object of many male desires (Ron's particularly), and though she was skilled at wizardry, she wasn't an especially affecting character. She did seem affected, however, and when she showed up again in Book Six, I, like Mrs. Weasley, rolled my eyes and dismissed her as a fluttery, vapid future supermodel.How wrong I was.One mark of a great writer, I think, is the ability to surprise the reader without cheating. That's J.K. Rowling. When something terrible befell Fleur's fiance, I was all set to mentally berate her for her superficiality. But rather than making a caricature out of Fleur---as I fear I unknowingly did---Rowling transformed her and made her deeply endearing with a couple elegant lines of dialogue.And I loved that. So here's to continual reminders to not judge people by appearances or even their seeming personalities. People can still surprise us, and we need to give them the opportunity to do so.*takes a deep breath*And lastly...3. Dumbledore: If you've read this far, you've only been assailed by minor spoilers. I don't want to spoil this plot twist, but I don't know how to talk about it without spoiling it. And the fact is, I don't want to talk about it.Rarely has a fictional character so resonated with me the way Albus Dumbledore has. In the first book he was wise, eccentric, and a constant source of comfort. As the series has developed, he has persisted in exhibiting those traits, but he has also grown more than most might think. He has revealed a penchant for trusting others too much. He has admitted how fallible he is, how prone to mistakes. He has been injured, accused of wrongdoing, and generally fed through a physical and emotional woodchipper.And he has come through it all with an open, caring heart and an enormous capacity for love. One passage in particular, I think, summarizes this amazing character for me. In a scene that chronicles how Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore attempts to gird Harry's resolve and confidence in the inevitable battle with his nemesis:\"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can---\"\"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficult that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\"\"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\"\"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means---love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down.\"Yes---just love,\" said Dumbledore.The above passage will strike some as too direct, too naive, or worst of all, too emotional.It struck me as incredibly beautiful. There are all sorts of belief systems in the world, and no two people are exactly alike in their beliefs. But what Dumbledore says here is something that, were it adopted by more people, would alter our world for the better. Harry, for all his flaws, usually acts with good intentions. He befriends Luna Lovegood (another one of my favorite characters in all of fiction), gives of himself to others, and is willing to suffer so that others won't have to experience the same pain. In other words, Harry loves.And so can Dumbledore. Which is why this book was so memorable, wonderful, and painful to me.I'm going to go now. My wife is making a delicious supper. My son and first daughter are ready to wrestle. And my three-year-old is racing around the house casting spells on the furniture with her Harry Potter stick.And for that, J.K. Rowling, I thank you.",

'I heard him telling your mum, Ron.' \nI'm really enjoying this series so far but this series gets darker and darker. the first three of this series were so funny and cute even though there were sad scenes on them and the fourth, fifth and sixth books contained so much pain and I even shed more tears for these book than I did for the the first three. I have lost a favorite character that always made me laugh and smile. this character is Sirus Black. I even still can't get over his death. but let's admit it that maybe there's a death of character that we will never get over.*takes deep breath* okay let's talk about this book \u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u2606\u30fb\u309c\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u2606\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\nPHLEGM\n I have never liked Fleur Delacour very much since I first saw her on the book four and then I saw her again on the book four as Bill's girlfriend or Fiancee and I also laughed when Ginny called Fleur Phlegm. I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back.ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD \nRon and Hermione\nI ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.And I was so angry in that moment 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. \nHarry And Ginny\nhave you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book  'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... \nDumbledore's death\nI admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys! ",

            "4.5 Golden Stars92%yeah, it was dark, but probably the most Hilarious book of HP; it IS a Comedy! I was rolling in laughter! by Hilarious Ron, sassy Harry & Hermione's wittiness & the unique fun in the writing style, the impression, the descriptions, the comparisons.anyway, don't get mad at me, but this book is my least favourite in Harry Potter series. it was kind of disappointment for me.3 years gap, reading the other fantastic books many times, guessing & after that shocking end in book 5, looking forward to this one, to be greater than others as we are close to end...in one sentence: I was not satisfied after reading it. (IK the book was the calm before the storm, but still.)& don't get me wrong; it was a disappointment Only compared to other HP books.Boring start. (2 chapters without anything related to Hogwarts or the golden trio)Harry was obsessed with what Malfoy was up to, the whole year & for the first time, I found Harry annoying many times. maybe this is the main reason I didn't like this book. (I hate 'Sectumsempra' chapter , always get mad at him.)yelling many times:Don't!No!you idiot, Harry!because he is my favourite character...\ud83d\udc94(though now after many times re-reading, I actually found funny parts too, thankfully)at the end, he was right though.also, lack of funny sarcastic verbal fights between Harry & Draco :(almost whole events were like side-jobs (except the... you-know-what); A.K.A the Slug clubtruth: I don't care about Slughorn either. those chapter he just talked & talked about celebrities once-were-his students... ughhhh. Adrenaline peak parts were not satisfying & not enough (amounts). the whole story was a bit ordinary & nothing happened in the whole school year, in particular. (like school wasn't at an immediate, solid grave danger (book 2, 3, 7 & maybe 5), the golden trio wasn't on solving mysteries (1, 2, 4, 5, 7) or something as intriguing as these. they were just attending classes, boring parties, slug club & these normal stuff.but in total, other parts (except Malfoy & Slug club); maybe not high peak of adrenaline (as I said), but interesting, we all wanted to know who the half-blood prince was, Quidditch was funny & the parts with Dumbledore was fascinating.I liked the second half of the book more, like finally this book stepped into action! & that end was the \"Beginning of the End\"!But main reason: his obsession with Malfoy; 'OMG! Harry, just come off it!', therefore Harry being annoying, therefore lack of Harry's sarcasm comebacks with Malfoy, lowered this book to my least favourite.BUT....on the bright side, there are parts I love too:\u2764 sassy Harry was the best!There's no need to call me \"sir\", professor. Bless you JKR!Bless you Harry Potter!one of the sassiest comments in the history of sass masters!my first reaction when I see this, was: \"omg! Harry! did you just...!?\" & then re-read the sentence to see if I got it right & then... putting the book down (\"Hail Harry Potter!\") & burst out laughing!\"Well, you can\u2019t break an Unbreakable Vow...\" (Gee! Thanks Ron!)\"I\u2019d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough!\u201dalthough there was no sarcastic comebacks between Harry & Malfoy, but this book had many funny moments by other characters.Harry was not just being sassy & sarcastic, but also being funny & clueless too, which was laughable.Ron's jokes with ghosts always made me choke with laughter!\"and I'll take his secret to the \u2014\"  \"\u2014 not the grave, surely?\" said Ron with a snort. \"The sewers, maybe.\"LOL a lot!\u2764 FriendshipsHarry & Ron's friendship (always one of my favourite brotps) funny, great, looking after each other. always love it, in all books.\"Nice,\" he said. \"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.\"  \"If you tell them,\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \"I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ll \u2014\"  \"Stutter at me?\" said Harry, grinning. \"Come on, would I!?\"Roonil Wazlib!also Harry & Hermione's. (especially after Ron & Hermione's bickering), beautiful, caring, protective. again, I love it in all the books.\u201cListen, Hermione, I can tell it\u2019s not a girl. I can just tell.\u201d\u201cThe truth is that you don\u2019t think a girl would have been clever enough,\u201d said Hermione angrily.\u201cHow can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?\u201d said Harry, stung by this.I actually noticed after years of rereading, now Romione has lowered in its place for me & I ship these two much more. they care so much for each other.(I'm thinking it's also a brotp for me too. well, it's complicated to decide if I want to accept the canon (because I do love canon too) or my mind. the point is, I love the moments with these two together :)\u2764 the writing style is just Unique & perfect & funny!\u2764 my favourite chapters are \"the Cave\" & \"Horcruxes\"; awesome, exciting with unexpected amount of surprises. I actually loved them.I loved the main-stream parts with Dumbledore.I loved how Harry, at some points, admired Tom.& how he unfolded this story & also sympathized with other characters.\u2764 I liked Dumbledore in this book.\u2764 at least after that terrible mistake (mentioned above), the chapter ended beautifully; my favourite part, that magical romantic moment, how well described, what a glamorous scene. My first ship finally sinking! \"Harry looked around; there was (view spoiler)[Ginny (hide spoiler)] running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour-or possibly several sunlit days- they broke apart.The creature in his chest roaring in triumph.\"(& I was really angry when the movie CHANGED this scene! actually I really loved the first 3 movies (they were so similar to the books) & 5 too (tho it was a bit different & they mostly deleted the humor parts), 4 was similar enough, just darker than my imagination. but movies 6 & 7 just had the same quotes (almost) & changed or deleted scenes a lot, therefore those completely disappointed me. :(\u2764 & I was proud Harry became (view spoiler)[Team Captain (hide spoiler)]!Quidditch were funny, especially the first one (You Clever Harry! XD). except not the commentator, but Harry made a funny moment of that too ;)\u2764 Don't forget how Gracefully this book was written. (& how delicate she chose to show they were swearing without any direct swears, I love it, it doesn't make me apprehensive, on the contrary, it makes me laugh very hard & respect the pure talent.)Hail Queen!10th read; November 2019: I could've given 5 Stars because of Sassy Harry (I mean, Harry just being savagely Sassy this year! XD) & beautiful, magnificent choices of the words & compare to a few of my 5 stars this book definitely deserves 5; but I'm not satisfied with it (still things that annoy me) so I probably won't. Although there's a progress, the rating score has risen to 4.5 now.13th read; June 2022: never have read this book this quick! thanks to BR with my new Potterhead!

(Which I have only given to the first book in this series.)God, how do you talk about this book? It\u2019s really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life. For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful!Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that\u2019s not true. I\u2019ll just come out and say it: I\u2019m really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He\u2019s high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I\u2019m devastated, which makes me even more upset, because I have a life to live today and can\u2019t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain.I\u2019m going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don\u2019t like this at ALL.Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He\u2019s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents\u2019 legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he\u2019s really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages.I didn\u2019t think I liked Ginny much, because I didn\u2019t remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was more of her in this book.Also, I\u2019ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He\u2019s really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn\u2019t last very long. Anyway.I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing she\u2019s not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she\u2019s not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry.Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone\u2019s favorite character? He\u2019s like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh.Harry and Ginny I\u2019m totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU\u2019RE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don\u2019t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks.Speaking of supposedly-good characters\u2019 downfalls: I\u2019m no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don\u2019t count. Harry and Hermione\u2019s constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that\u2019s who I am, and she\u2019s annoying in this book. AND IT\u2019S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE\u2019S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again.Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he\u2019s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS.I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren\u2019t here nearly enough. The price of Harry\u2019s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I\u2019M SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I\u2019d feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.)But I want to give this book five stars more than anything. It was so compulsively readable, more than any other book since the first for me. And it\u2019s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It\u2019s such a gorgeous setting and I\u2019m going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I\u2019ll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed.And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I\u2019m really going to miss this series. I\u2019ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it\u2019s been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I\u2019m rereading it after 10 years, it\u2019s like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS.Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else\u2019s?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream.----------ORIGINAL REVIEW---------------Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead. Also seven more books!",

There were things I'd forgotten, e.g. how late Harry and Ginny got together. I'd also forgotten about most of the funeral. I'll say no more, spoilers oblige.What this book tells me is that sadly the more conservative of readers, grammarians etc will place so many books above Harry Potter #6, none of which is worth mentioning in the same breath as Potter lore.To me this series is special. Nobody else will undertake waiting for each book to come out and lay our hands on them. The Potter universe will belong to our descendants forever. But it was we who helped create this fervor and unmatched popularity.",

Slughorn\u2019s belly preceded him out of the door. Bahaha6. Potions class has never been this cheerful. Thanks Grampy Sloghorn and Harry has never performed better. Thanks to cheating. Lol.7. Ron, you bollocks! Stop being an idiot, WonWon!8. Voldemort as a student seems to me even more sinister than the Dark Lord he already is. *shivers*9. Like Harry, I am Dumbledore\u2019s man through and through. Take that, Rufus!10. I\u2019d go back to school anytime if it meant having Professor Dumbledore as a teacher. 11. Aherm! Why do you keep looking for Ginny, now Harry?12. There\u2019s a reason a Dark Arts teacher stays only for a year. It\u2019s all clear now.13. Who would have thought that the once timid Ginny will blossom into a confident, beautiful, charming, funny and best of all, snarky girl?14. Chapter 24 will particularly make you swoon! Gaaah! (view spoiler)[ I ship Harry and Ginny! <3  (hide spoiler)]15. RIP, Aragog.16. For the first time, I solved the mystery! (view spoiler)[ I have guessed early on in the story that the Half Blood Prince was Snape! Yaaas! (hide spoiler)] 17. I knew there was a reason Harry spent so much time with Professor Dumbledore. I can\u2019t\u2026*sobs* Some of the things/characters missing in the movie: 1. Kreacher and Dobby2. Bill and Fleur3. Dumbledore\u2019s Army and the Order of the Phoenix putting up a fight against the Dark Eaters.4. . Harry breaking up with Ginny which reminds me of Peter Parker and Mj. Finally, as a simple tribute to the wisest, kindest, most revered and one of the most powerful wizards (whose death out of the many deaths hurts me the most that I cried so much, I may have cried harder than Hagrid), the following is a collection of a few of his great thoughts and words that\u2019ll be forever etched in our hearts. *sniffs*  \u201cIn fact, being-forgive me- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.\u201d  \u201cPeople find it a lot easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.\u201d  \u201cIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\u201d   \u201cWords are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.\"   \u201cThe pain is part of being human. The fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.\u201d   \u201cTo the well organized mind, death is but the next adventure.\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s not really goodbye after all.\u201d On a lighter note, it's beautiful Katerina's birthday today, let's spare a few moments to greet her a HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY! Even though you're quite busy for Goodreads and reading atm, I hope you're doing something that's making you happy today! Enjoy! <3",

People you trust turn out to be not who they say they are (or so we think\u2026) The last 2 hours of this 18 hour audio book broke my heart. I almost want to wait a while to do the final book, but I really want to finish these books by the end of 2016 so I better start it straight away. Wish me luck! I know I\u2019ll need it xoxo "
